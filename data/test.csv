1037,How can I have a better sex life when I don't like sex?,"Human Sexuality,Intimacy,Marriage","<p>There are many different ways that can be approached in your situation.</p><p>1.

1038,I feel completely alone in my marriage.,"Marriage,Relationships,Intimacy","<p>I can think of several things that may help you to reconnect. I don't know how much time you actually spend together, but one thing you could try is to spend 15 minutes a week together talking about common interests or other things that make you feel connected.</p><p>Have you considered a date night or anything (doesn't have to cost a lot of money, but could make each of you feel special)?</p><p>Something else you could try is to consider talking to each other in a way where you summarize what you are hearing and reflect back to make sure that you got it right rather than just assuming so. Communicating this way can feel awkward at times, but it could reconnect how you are listening and deeply connecting with your partner. Also, you may discover that you are on two different pages about things on which you thought you understood what each other felt, wanted, or desired.</p><p>Consider what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or special. Can you name a few things and get them right according to your partner when you check in? Can he do the same for you?</p><p>You could also try doing two things every day that would be appreciated by your partner without either of you having to ask for it. There is some more information here, although what you do for one another does not necessarily need to be on this list:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.couplesinstitute.com/tracking-success-by-doing-the-daily-double/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.couplesinstitute.com/tracking-success-by-doing-the-daily-double/</a></p><p>Reconnecting is a bit of a process. Try to praise yourself and your partner for attempts that you make and recognize that you're not going to get it right 100% of the time. You may also find this book to be helpful (or there are other similar ones by the same author):&nbsp;<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471479801&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Love+languages"">https://smile.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471479801&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Love+languages</a></p><p>If this still seems difficult, consider seeing a local mental health professional. As one more thought, recall that this relationship involves both of you. If you are both committing to change your level of connection, change will likely not be a steady uphill climb (there could be plateaus or even some dips back in a negative direction) and each of you may change at a different rate.</p><p>Best wishes in your quest for connection!</p>"
1039,I think I empathize too much.,Diagnosis,"<p>It sounds like this would be difficult at times, particularly if you feel misunderstood.</p><p>You may or may not know that we all have chemicals in our brain. We also have different sections of our brain that become active when different things happen. There is a part of our brain where a lot of our emotions originate that is also designed to protect us when we are going through things that have been physically or emotionally painful in the past, and when that part of the brain is sometimes overactive (perceiving threat when there is no actual threat at the time), sometimes anxiety can develop. This doesn't necessarily mean that everyone has an anxiety disorder, but often if we are afraid of something that is not actually a legitimate concern (for example, most insects are not going to hurt me, but I still do not like them very much), we have anxiety about it.</p><p>The first thing I thought of when I read your question is that perhaps some part of your brain are overactive. I did find an article that may be helpful to you, but I just want to caution you. Not everything listed here applies to you. Also, the article uses the term ""brain anomalies."" This does not mean that there is something majorly wrong with your brain. While I cannot tell you exactly what is happening, I'm asking you not to panic over the term and to just consider that perhaps some of the chemical reactions in your brain may be a little overactive, which may be able to be corrected with medication or something similar. I can't tell for certain from what you posted whether or not this is what is happening, but I would recommend that you either talk to your primary care physician or a therapist or psychiatrist.</p><p>Here is the article:&nbsp;<a href=""http://blogs.psychcentral.com/addiction-recovery/2012/09/too-much-empathy/"" target=""_blank"">http://blogs.psychcentral.com/addiction-recovery/2012/09/too-much-empathy/</a></p><p>When you meet with your doctor or a therapist, please try to convey how much this is affecting your life.</p><p>Thank you so much for posting here and I wish you the best.</p>"
1040,How do you overcome an embarrassing mistake and forgive yourself?,Self-esteem,"<p>Sometimes we make ourselves feel worse with our own thoughts about things we can't change. We know that it is possible to overcome embarrassment and self-blame, but why does it seem so difficult to overcome it sometimes? If you tune into your own thoughts, or your ""internal dialogue"", you'll notice that your thoughts are connected to your feelings. So people who are holding onto embarrassment and self-blame often have thoughts like, ""How could I do that?"", ""I looked so stupid!"" ""Now people saw things I did not want them to see!"" If we tune in more, we might notice we are thinking that this is terrible, horrible, and that we cannot deal with it. These are self-sabotaging thoughts that lead to shame, self-blame and embarrassment. If you look at the evidence, you can find more rational thoughts such as, "" We all make mistakes"", ""People can look all different ways at different time - this incident does not define me!"" and ""If someone has a bad image or thought about me, it is really OK! People have all kinds of thoughts about other people, and it does not have to be a major problem."" When you practice your rational thoughts often and replace the negative ones, you will start to feel better, more confident and your embarrassment will decrease quickly.<br></p>"
1041,What's going on with these mood swings?,"Behavioral Change,Social Relationships","<p>Teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind - so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development. You are not at all alone.</p><p>You've taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware! The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts, the more you can learn to manage them. Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try - for example, identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response, such as taking a deep breath, informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space, or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk. Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out, you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as ""I am responsible for my efforts"" and ""Blame is not helpful for anyone"" and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight. When you practice thinking more rational, healthy thoughts, you are actually rewiring your brain, so practice is key!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1042,What are the best ways to reduce anxiety?,"Anxiety,Stress","<div>Since it is clear that people react differently to the same&nbsp;stressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, <b>our thoughts</b> about the stressors are. Often, cognitive distortions are the problem. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind-reading (I just know he is angry at me) and can't-standitis (I can't stand this situation). There are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local CBT therapist. </div><div><br></div><div>Another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called ""symptom stress"" - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, ""Oh no I'm getting nervous about this, I'm getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack!"" followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;more cognitive distortions such as ""I can't stand being anxious!"" and ""this is horrible!""&nbsp;The&nbsp;antidote to this is acceptance.&nbsp; Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon Kabat-Zinn). If you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself - this is just a reaction I'm having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. I can tolerate and survive some anxiety, I can breathe deeply,&nbsp;and I'll be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.</div><div><br></div><div>We can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. We have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, "" we learn what we&nbsp;believe when we hear ourselves speak,"" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)<br></div>"
1043,What's wrong with me for going to summer school?,Family Conflict,<p>There is nothing wrong with going to summer school.&nbsp;</p>
1044,I think I empathize too much.,Diagnosis,"<p>Sometimes it's helps to have a name for a problem - it can make you feel less alone as in, ""oh there's a name for this and other people have this experience too."" On the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in ""now I have a special problem that has a special name, and that's an important part of who I am.""<br><br>Bottom line, whether it's a disorder or not, you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other people's energy and feelings. You might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy (just like the volume dial or button on the tv) that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel what's going on but it's not so ""loud"". You can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being, letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far. This is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability. Just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else, your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted.</p>"
1045,Why can't I let myself trust my partner?,Relationships,"<p>What's most important is that you recognize that what you've been doing is off base - that what you've been feeling is ""overreacting,"" that you have ""insecurities,"" and you suspect your actions and reactions are connected to your own past and not to the current situation or to your partner. That's an excellent first step because without recognizing these things about yourself, it's unlikely that you would change.<br><br>That said, you sound as if you are really ready to start some therapy to work on your own personal growth... not because there is something ""wrong"" with you, but because you're ready to learn more about yourself and make some creative changes in your behavior. Yes, there are lots of self-help books and courses, but we humans often make the most progress when we have support in&nbsp;<span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">real-time</span><span style=""line-height: 1.42857;"">&nbsp;from another human being who can sit with us, point out our blind spots, and teach us some skills that are hard to learn on our own.</span></p>"

1056,How can you get back to my old self?,"Depression,Relationships",Sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too. &nbsp;I would wonder about your experience with anger and if you've ever been discouraged from expressing anger. &nbsp;I would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really aren't being heard. &nbsp;It's hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you don't feel accepted by them.

1067,How do I let go of the abuse my dad showed me?,Trauma,<p>I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling. &nbsp;Getting to know yourself after a trauma (especially at the hands of a caregiver) and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying. &nbsp;I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace. &nbsp;You are not your trauma. &nbsp;You are good and you are whole. &nbsp;Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you.</p>

1070,Why do I feel worthless and tired?,Depression,"You are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression: low self esteem, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, sad mood, feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness. A full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that ""Do you think you are depressed?"" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . I'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. &nbsp;It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. &nbsp;I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. &nbsp;I hope you find this information helpful. The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life."
1071,Should I be upset that my husband may have lied to me again?,"Marriage,Intimacy","<p>Let's look at your question and break it down. It begins with the word <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">should. </span>As a first reflection, it implies that there is a right and a wrong way to feel, in this case, feel upset. I think I would like to ask you the question in a different way: are you feeling upset? If you are feeling upset or if you are feeling another emotion : insert worried, ambivalent, scared, angry, insecure, confused that is likely reasonable if the relationship has undergone some breaks in trust followed by distance (seperation). The first step is to recognize what you are feeling, and accept it for what it is-- an emotion. A feeling. You are entitled to feel a range of emotions as you are in the process of repairing or rebuilding the marriage. It is what you <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;do</span>&nbsp;with that feeling that matters-- how you act, how you think, what you say, &nbsp;and the impact the emotion (likely emotion<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">s) </span>have on&nbsp;your relationship and in turn your quality of life that matters. If you want to discuss the impact of your feelings on you or on your marriage, I suggest you consult with a mental health professional with expertise in couple therapy/ relationship issues. I hope you find this information helpful.&nbsp;</p>"
1072,I feel completely alone in my marriage.,"Marriage,Relationships,Intimacy","<p>What you are describing is something I often refer to as ""living with your roommate"" phenomenon. This is the idea that you feel like you are living with a roommate and no your partner or spouse . It is not uncommon for members of a couple to report to feel both physical and/or emotional distance. When we don't feel connected within relationships, this can be isolating and lonely. The emotional distance often makes us wonder: am I important to the other? These types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing I.e., who you are and also better understood in the context of your couple. Feeling reconnected can occur-- but there is not a ""one size fits all"" solutoon. As a first step, do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected? Have you considering talking to your partner about the emotional void? Or how about discussing &nbsp;solutions , together, that might help-- from individual therapy to couple therapy to a weekly date night to inquiring about one another's personal interest to starting off the conversation of what <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">both </span>of you want and can do to re-establish feelings of connectiveness. If this is too frightening I.e., to address the lack of connection between you and your spouse. &nbsp;a fist meeting with a couple therapist can likely help unpack what the possible solutions for your couple.</p>"
1073,I feel completely alone in my marriage.,"Marriage,Relationships,Intimacy","<p>Your question highlights your pain very clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward.&nbsp;My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?&nbsp; What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need?&nbsp; Does this lead to arguments?&nbsp; Do you stay silent or withdraw?</p><p>Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as ""cold and aloof"" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as ""critical and nagging"").&nbsp; Regardless of ""who started it,"" these patterns can&nbsp;turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship.&nbsp; If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together.&nbsp; As the patterns&nbsp;slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.</p><p>Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist.&nbsp; The book ""Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love"" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see.&nbsp; When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy.&nbsp; You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: <a href=""http://www.iceeft.com"">http://www.iceeft.com</a>).</p><p>To summarize:</p><p>Your pain is understandable and valid.&nbsp; It's telling you what you are missing and what you want.</p><p>Reconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us, express those feelings in a safe way, and assert our wants/needs,&nbsp;while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partner.</p><p>If you can do that on your own, and your relationship is responsive, that's fantastic!&nbsp; If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself, consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated.&nbsp; <br><br></p><p>Pain means this is important!&nbsp; You and your marriage are worth the effort!<br></p>"

Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving.</span>&nbsp;A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues.

1086,I have difficulty with communication.,"Anxiety,Stress","<p>A good way to start is the language or ""self talk"" that is happening inside your mind. &nbsp;Looking at your question, when it is said that the presentations ""make me feel stress"" you are giving the responsibility of the stress to the presentations and taking that away from your self. &nbsp;The presentations cannot give or take away your stress, that's something only you can do and you can do it! &nbsp; What language can you change in your self talk? &nbsp;For example, are you saying ""I can't speak in front of an audience! I'll fail?"" &nbsp;That sounds a lot different than ""I studied my butt off and if I practice speaking out loud, I can ace this presentation!"" &nbsp;Although this is a short answer, I do believe that counseling will help you overcome these stressful feelings and bring out your inner confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

There are most likely too many feelings to feel right now, so your body in its wisdom is shutting them down.

1094,Is it possible for a person to stop feeling emotions?,Trauma,"<p>Terrible things do happen in life, and I am sorry to hear about what happened to you. Please rest assured that you are not a sociopath, and that your reactions are normal responses to traumatic events. I'm guessing you are experiencing a sense of numbness, which is a common response to trauma. The best thing you can do is to get some trauma counseling with a professional counselor. &nbsp;As you process your experience, you will be able to feel emotions again. However, the first feelings to come back may be related to trauma, such as fear, panic, and a sense of hyper vigilance. A professional counselor will be able to help you tolerate these feelings, manage them, and heal from your trauma.</p>"
1095,How can I be less afraid of rape?,Anxiety,"<p>Why are you afraid of rape? Because it is a problem in the United States! The National Sexual Violence Resource Center reports that one in five women (0r 20%) will be raped (http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) and that 80% of women know their assailant. Given these statistics, it is perfectly logical to be afraid. However, there are things you can do to reduce the risk of rape, such as being aware of your surroundings, and limiting the use of drugs or alcohol.</p><p>The Enhanced Access, Knowledge, Act program for college-aged women has been shown to reduce the risk of rape by more than 50%.

1096,Is it possible for a person to stop feeling emotions?,Trauma,"<p>You're not a sociopath - you're traumatized. Shutting off feelings is our brain's automatic way of protecting us when something bad happens and we just can't deal with any more pain. It's temporary - which is both good and bad news, because after the numb goes away and your brain decides you're ready to handle it, you'll feel the emotional pain. &nbsp;My advice is to get a therapist ASAP so you have a safe place and a safe person when that happens.</p><p>This is a horrible thing that happened to you, but you are not a horrible person. With good therapy you will learn to assimilate this into the rest of your life. You'll never forget, but you won't have the same pain about it &nbsp;.</p><p>Good luck! You can do this!</p>"
1097,I want to become a better man.,Relationships,"<p>What an important question, and the fact that you're asking it is a big step in the right direction. To answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what ""relationship problems"" have occurred &nbsp;that woke you up to the fact that you're not listening as well as you could and that you're running the risk of losing her.<br><br>Given that I don't have all that information, I'll offer one simple suggestion. Your girlfriend is the expert on what <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">she</span> needs and wants in relationship. You could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize you're not yet understanding what she needs <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">and</span>&nbsp;you really want to. Then take a deep breath, settle down, and listen. Don't argue, don't interrupt, don't judge... listen. Let her know what you understand and that you're open to hearing more, learning more if you're not quite getting it yet... and then listen some more. Be present and curious about this person you love dearly and don't want to lose. This is the first step toward intimacy.</p>"
1098,I want to become a better man.,Relationships,"<p>Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. <br></p><p>It does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. <br></p><p>Ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. <br></p><p>Personally, I am big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. </span>Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman's book on Amazon for under $9. It's a good deal. <br></p><p>There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. <br></p><p>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships/effective-communication.htm</p><p> You can try them and see if they are helpful. <br></p><p>***It is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. <br></p><p>I hope these suggestions help, and good luck.</p><p>Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC <br></p>"
1099,I want to become a better man.,Relationships,"<p>Thanks for your question. Becoming a good listener is an essential piece in being a better communicator. Being an effective communicator will almost always improve the quality of your relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>What stands in your way of listening to her? Do you find yourself becoming defensive when she brings up issues? Do you often find yourself thinking of what you want to say next? Do you take her words personally, preventing you from having the ability to problem solve?</p><p>Here are some tips that may help you with being a better listener:</p><p>1. Concentrate on what you are hearing, not on what you will say next.</p><p>2. Ask questions if you need clarification or don't understand.</p><p>3. Summarize what you're hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that you're not missing anything.</p><p>4. Ask your partner what she needs from you. Is she expecting advice or does she simply need to vent?</p><p>5. Keep eye contact and avoid using non-verbal cues that demonstrate defensiveness or irritation such as eye rolling or crossing your arms.</p><p>6. Remember that it's okay to disagree and, if this is the case, then decide as a team, how you want to move forward.</p><p>I hope this helps. Good luck to you!</p>"

1101,I want to become a better man.,Relationships,"<p>The first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that, so you are already on the right track.</p><p>As far as learning how to listen, try some of these steps:</p><ul><li>Ask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversation</li><li>If she has a subject that she would like to discuss, consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience. These questions usually begin with words like who, what, where, when. Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicate</li><li>Then you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience. You could also start by talking about something that is important to you.</li><li>Remember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesn't mean that you agree</li><li>Also, try sticking to one subject at a time. It's difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or two</li><li>Try to use the word want or wish instead of need. Saying that you need something (or if your girlfriend would say that) that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to change</li></ul><p>Something else to try would be using some sort of timeout. Consider this:</p><ul><li>Discuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five, 10, 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour. When there are a lot of emotions happening, each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving.</li><li>When using timeout, say to your girlfriend (or she can say to you) ""I need an hour before we can go back to this."" Then actually come back to the discussion.</li><li>Some people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way. This is why the agreement is important before you need it.</li></ul><p>While it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you, it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.</p><p>Try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants, wishes, and desires while recognizing those of your partner.</p><p>As one final idea, consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problem-solving about anything, just connecting with one another.</p><p>I encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you.</p><p>Best wishes!</p>"
1102,I want to become a better man.,Relationships,"<p>The best tool for becoming a better listener that I know of is called Imago Dialogue. It consists of 3 steps:</p><p>1. Mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn't.</p><p>2. Validating. You tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (If you don't understand, then find a way.) You can also say, ""That makes sense"" or ""I hear you"" or ""I get that.""</p><p>3. Empathizing. Tell her how you think she must feel about what she's telling you. Your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her.</p><p>This is a very different way of communicating than we're used to. My guess is that the arguments, discussions, and debates you've had with her have been counterproductive because you're both trying to win. With Imago Dialogue, you both win. She gets to be heard and you get to hear for a change.</p><p>At the end of the exercise, switch roles.

1106,Why do I feel sad all the time?,"Family Conflict,Depression","<p>Hello,</p><p>While one can be sad from time to time, feeling sad ""all the time"" could be a sign of depression. If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process. You do not have to deal with it alone. Dr. Virginia Chow, Montreal Psychologist.

1108,Why do I feel like I'm always wrong in everything in my relationship?,"Relationships,Marriage,Workplace Relationships","Hello. That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship, especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story, I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define ""infidelity"". Currently, there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up, chatroom texting, extensive phone calls to a female friend, viewing pornography, a massage with happy ending, physical intercourse, or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured, you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it, then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying, ""I feel you distancing from me."" In other words, it's not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times, accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so, what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true, you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise, if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong, the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a ""sweetheart."" The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean ""you're so sweet and kind"", ""my dear"", or in a flirtatious manner to mean ""sweetie."" The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context, it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. &nbsp;If she finds the term disrespectful, it may be her way of expressing, ""I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much."" Therefore, arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather, the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying ""sweetheart"" to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said, if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding, accomodating and prioritizing her needs, then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.</div><div><br></div><div>The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she's wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults, it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately, blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing, which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of, ""I'm sorry."" However, it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice, when a client tells me that his or her partner never says ""I'm sorry"", I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it, then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn't do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation, which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For more information about these services, you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.</div><div><br></div>"
1109,Why do I always push my boyfriend away?,"Intimacy,Relationships","<p>There could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away. It could be part of how you were raised, it could be because of culture, it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you ""pushing"" him away.&nbsp;</p><p>What is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect. So what if you aren't a hugger, a kisser, or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship. There are many ways to show affection that aren't physical (words of affirmation, giving of time and/or gifts, etc). If your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching.</p>"
1110,Why do I feel like I'm always wrong in everything in my relationship?,"Relationships,Marriage,Workplace Relationships",<p>Here is the truth: You will never get her to understand! because that would mean changing her and we can't change other people we can only change ourselves. I would recommend to take the time to self reflect on what exactly it is that you are doing that is contributing to the mixup. You both have very valid feelings and those won't magically go away until you address the root problem (which could be many factors).&nbsp;</p><p>I am curious to know more about past relationships the both of you have had and how that plays a role in your current relationship. Many times we don't realize how past relationships truly impact our current behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
1111,How can I have a better sex life when I don't like sex?,"Human Sexuality,Intimacy,Marriage","<p>I work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges. The one aspect I tell many folks that I work with, is this: Every person and relationship is different. There really isn't a ""normal"" amount of sex a person should have or want to have. If having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If you or your husband would like to have sex more often, I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied. <br></p><p>The aspect of connectedness is an important one. While sex can be very connecting for many couples, it isn't the only way to connect. I find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex, checking in to see how you and your husband feel, as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this need.<br></p>"
1112,"I want to have a threesome with my husband and another girl, but  I feel really nervous.","Human Sexuality,Intimacy,Relationships","<p>Hello, and thank you for your question. Nervousness, when doing something new, especially something sexual that can feel so personal, is very common. Indeed, despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable, it is also part of the excitement of trying something new. <br></p><p>Many people who engage in open, polyamorous, and/or other-type relationships, will tell you that difficult feelings, such as jealousy and anger, do show up sometimes. This doesn't prove that there is something wrong with the relationship, it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one. And many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work. Of course, all relationships take work, so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception. <br></p><p>There could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do. One reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are. Some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this. Another reason this may be bothering you is because, on some level, you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages. They are supposed to be monogamous, heterosexual, etc. etc. Just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesn't mean that you haven't been influenced by them. We all have. <br></p><p>Another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening. Perhaps there are a lot of ""What ifs"" going on in your mind. When you get the ""empty"" feeling, it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling. <br></p><p>One thing that I do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband. It may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ""ground rules"", if you will. It is important that you are both on the same page about what this is, and why you are doing it. <br></p><p>If you continue to struggle, I suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality.&nbsp; I wish you well.</p><p><br></p><p>Robin J.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-fareast-font-family:"" times="""" new="""" roman"";="""" mso-bidi-font-family:""times="""" roman""""="""">Let's just start with being real. Expressing
yourself is vulnerable, and being vulnerable is hard. It takes courage and work
to be vulnerable. My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable (ie, expressing yourself) is unsafe. My assumption would be
you have been criticized, or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past, it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again. This is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt. It
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional way.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">I would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself. Check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally. After you feel you have a good grasp
on this, start to engage in emotional conversations with others. Choose others that
feel safe to you, a good friend that knows you well, or a sibling or family
member. Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection, so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same. Best of luck!</span></p>

1115,How can I keep a long distance relationship going?,"Relationships,Military Issues ","<p>Hello. You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges, with the proper communication, commitment, and understanding, many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.&nbsp;</p><p>Without knowing more about the ""complicated"" nature of your relationship, I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? &nbsp;Or, is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter, you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on ""what if"" situations, the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if there is reason for you to question his fidelity, you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation, you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly, or to include you more in his life, or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice, that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text, phone, and Skype. It's hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner, and it's hard to build a relationship when you don't know what's going on in your partner's life. Other times, it is Making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication, understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship, but this is especially true for long-distance ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Virginia Chow</p><p>www.PsychologyResource.ca</p>"
1116,How can I keep a long distance relationship going?,"Relationships,Military Issues ","<p>You're right that long-distance relationships can be complicated. If he loves you and you love him, that's a great start. I wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved, valued, special, and appreciated.</p><p>When having important discussions, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Make sure it is a good time to have a discussion (and if you're doing it in writing because of the distance, you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesn't have 10 minutes or something like that)</li><li>Try to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other. Asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversations.</li><li>When having discussions face-to-face, I often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them. As for how that translates to distance, maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the Internet (or, if possible, use some kind of timeframe).</li></ul><p>Consider what questions you would like answers to. For example, are you wondering:</p><ul><li>What should I do if I miss you or want to talk to you more? I don't want to make you feel guilty, but I also don't want to hide my feelings. Can I share them with you?</li><li>If you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly, can I keep sending you messages or is that overwhelming?</li><li>How will you ask for support from me?</li><li>Some couples really want to protect each other. In doing so, instead of hiding our emotions, can we share them and work through them together?</li><li>Whatever else comes to mind.</li></ul><p>Gary Chapman is famous for his books about the 5 Love Languages. He has one specifically for military families:&nbsp;The 5 Love Languages Military Edition: The Secret to Love That Lasts.</p><p>Here's a list of books related to loving from a distance:&nbsp;http://www.longdistancerelationships.net/bookstor.htm</p><p>I have not read these books myself, but I have read other works by a lot of the authors.</p><p>One final tip: Consider making a list of times when you work together and both feeling calm, safe, and comfortable.

1121,How can I ask my boyfriend about who he's texting?,Relationships,"<p>I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship, you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others. These questions help couples to build connection and trust. It's based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support, openess, understanding, empathy), you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner, it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner, it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way, you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive, then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Virginia Chow</p><p>www.PsychologyResource.ca</p>"

1125,Overcoming fears.,"Anxiety,Behavioral Change","<p>Hello, and thank you for your question. Overcoming fears is something that everyone struggles with at one time or another. Sometimes we come across something that scares us, we push through it and suddenly we aren't afraid anymore. But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. There are some options:</p><p>1. You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. For example, if you have a general phobia about something, they may use various techniques to help you manage it.&nbsp; <br></p><p><br></p><p>2. There are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias, exposure therapy well-studied and proven to work. A therapist would help you with this, but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself. I am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself, but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools. http://psychology.tools/anxiety.html</p><p><br></p><p>Some colleagues may offer you some other types of advice. Be well.</p><p>Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC<br></p><p><br></p>"
1126,I just feel so alone.,"Relationships,Social Relationships","<p>Although we can have moments when we feel alone, even with the presence of family and friends, feeling alone most of the time could be a sign that there is a lack of connection between you and your loved ones. Generally, the lack of connection can occur when you don't feel heard, understood or valued. These are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness.&nbsp;</p><p>You mentioned that ""they listen but don't understand."" Do you communication clearly about what you need emotionally (understood, accepted, valued, heard, empathized)? To help you ask for the right type of support, you can ask yourself what it is about the situation that is bothering you and how you would wish for your friends and family to respond to you. The result may be an answer that is more informative to your loved ones. For example, you might say, ""Thank you for listening to me. When I feel alone, I feel like nobody cares about me because everybody seems busy with their lives. I just wanted to hear and feel that I'm valued by receiving caring messages and phone calls.""&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Virginia Chow</p><p>www.psychologyresource.ca</p>"
1127,Why can't I change?,Behavioral Change,"Hello, and thank you for your question. Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:<br><br>1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change, and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like, ""I want to be more confident"" but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do, and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is, make sure it is something you can actually change. <br><br>2. If you are going to give up a behavior, decide what you are going to do in place of it. So, if you are going to stop showing up late for work, then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. <br><br>3. If you are going to make changes, really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example, if you have the goal of weight loss, the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. <br><br>4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes, I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So, make the goal small, realistic, and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. <br><br>5. As Sherry mentioned, finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help. <br><p><br></p><p>Be well,</p><p>Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC<br></p>"

Instead, its when&nbsp;you follow up by inquiring and listening to others that&nbsp;you &nbsp;may discover they feel and think and struggle just like you do.&nbsp;And as a result, you discover you really were never alone; when people discover common struggle and feelings, we are connected.&nbsp; Second, we as humans are sometimes feeling alone because we may be lacking some self-acceptance.&nbsp; Not fully accepting myself or situation , can be in the way of feeling the presence of others or the hearing the voice of others too.&nbsp;Or in other words, not bein&nbsp;'ok' with&nbsp;myself makes it difficult being with others. &nbsp;Third; feeling alone may be us not clear on what we are really needing from another person?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>These are just some thoughts to consider.&nbsp; Aloneness feels so real; and yet it has much to do with our perspective and view of things...&nbsp; we are all alone in a crowded world until we speak and listen more closely.</p><p>Kindly</p><p>-keith hughes M.A.&nbsp; keithcounseling.com <br></p>"
1130,Do I have some type of anxiety?,Anxiety,"<p>Feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes we're not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety, i. e., heart racing, sweaty palms, sweating, shortness of breath. It's important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body &amp; mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us, which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals, like adrenaline or cortisol. &nbsp;So, one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety, such as fear, stress. negative thought patterns, not enough food or sleep. Keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills &amp; techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep. One quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes, sometimes this is called belly breathing. When you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates. Many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath, and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress &amp; anxiety .&nbsp;</p>"
1131,"How can I get ""out of my head"" and stop obsessive thoughts?",Behavioral Change,"<p>Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel, but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do, but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time, our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don't pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way, i.e., scary, angry, happy, sad, and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So, how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen, he wrote the book Buddha's Brain,"" he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way, the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way, but I don't have time to go into all of that in this response. So, it's just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking, actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, &nbsp;this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments, and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.&nbsp;</p>"
1132,How can I ask my boyfriend about who he's texting?,Relationships,"<p>I think honesty is the right approach in this situation. Share with him that you looked at his phone, as well as sharing with him any fears or concerns that you're having about the long distance relationship. Trust is the foundation of any successful relationship and when doubt &amp; distrust creep into a relationship it can undermine the long term health of the relationship. Hopefully, he will understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty. This also might be a good time to seek couples counseling to work on relationship &amp; communication skills.</p>"
1133,How can I get counseling  if my primary care physician won't help?,Depression,"<p>I would check out agencies that offer affordable counseling based on your income or very low cost counseling sessions, i.e., Pacific Clinics, Hathaway Sycamore, Pasadena Mental Health Center, Burbank Family Center. If you google affordable or low cost therapy in your particular area you will find resources to help you.&nbsp;</p>"
1134,Thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety,"Anxiety,Spirituality","<p>Religious questioning is a complex and often philosophical topic, and these types of questions, especially around heaven, hell, and an afterlife can bring up a host of difficult &amp; confusing feelings.

Scary thoughts, negative thoughts, obsessive thoughts sometimes feel like they're out of control and there is nothing we can do to stop them, but I want to offer two techniques that might assist with your panic &amp; anxiety.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 22px; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them.

Sure, there are some who successfully live this lifestyle, but it only works when both people are completely secure in their relationship with each other, harbor no jealousies or insecurities, and aren't looking to someone else to satisfy needs that aren't getting met by their spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me say that again: This is not likely to work out well for you if either of you are insecure, jealous, or looking to have needs met by this other person that you aren't getting from your spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>That empty feeling you're having - listen to it. Dig deep to find out where it is coming from. What thoughts are going through your head when you feel that way? You'll get the answer.</p><p>The other thing that helps make something like this work is for both of you to listen and respect each other. If you don't like it that he paid more attention to the other girl, he needs to know that, and he needs to respect that. &nbsp;If you're going to do it again, he needs to know what you're comfortable with and what you want. Set the limits before you're in the moment, before it's too late to take an action back. Turn it around and ask him what he would be comfortable with if it were a man instead of a woman.</p><p>It is perfectly natural to be curious and want to experiment. A lot of people get that out of the way before settling down in a monogamous relationship. People who marry young and/or inexperienced may still feel that curiosity about things like that and want to experience them, but don't want to hurt their spouse. The REASON you are both doing this matters a lot. If there are problems in your relationship, this is likely to only make things worse.</p>"
1136,I crossdress and I don't know how to feel about it.,"Human Sexuality,LGBTQ","<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hi there! It sounds like you have already started to answer
your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much, and I am
glad you enjoy it! Cross dressing is something many people enjoy, and there is
no harm in it whatsoever.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My question to you would be: What is making you feel torn
about it? There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with
people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the
majority. (And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or
even in the majority, but because people carry shame about being different when
it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone!)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Being a sexual or gender minority or someone who
participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a
unique and personal way often means suffering from something called
""internalized oppression"". We grow up being exposed to certain
assumptions and beliefs about what is ""acceptable"" behavior and even
face consequences sometimes if we don't ""fit in"" the way others tell
us to. Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong, we still internalize
them and feel guilty about who we are. There is nothing wrong with us, but
feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment,
or like something is ""wrong"" with us.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">But there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, so be proud
of who you are and what you enjoy. You can continue to simply enjoy it
privately, or maybe you'd eventually like to share it with a partner or maybe
even join a community with similar interests. I'll leave you with a quote from
comedian Eddie Izzard, who identifies as, in his own words, a ""straight
transvestite"": ""They’re not women’s clothes. They’re my clothes. I
bought them!"" Take care, and thanks for your question!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p></o:p></p>"
1137,Do I have to go to counseling to get hormones to transition from female to male?,LGBTQ,"<p>Hi there, and thanks for your question! To answer your question, I'm going to point you to a link from Dara Hoffman-Fox's blog. Dara is a gender therapist like myself, and everything Dara says is very accurate!&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://darahoffmanfox.com/ask-gender-therapist-want-transition-see-therapist/"" target=""_blank"">Ask a Gender Therapist: “I Want to Transition – Do I Have to See a Therapist?”</a></p><p>Also, since you asked specifically about hormones, it really depends on where you live, how accessible transgender friendly medical providers/endocrinologists are in your area, and also whether you feel you would benefit from counseling-regardless of whether a counselor's letter of referral is required from your medical provider. I hope this information helps!&nbsp;</p>"
1138,I don't want to keep going back and forth between my parents' houses.,"Anxiety,Parenting,Family Conflict","<p>I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.</p><p><br></p><p>I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.</p><p>I do see some positives, though.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better.&nbsp;</p><p>Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.&nbsp;</p>"
1139,About a year ago I found out my husband had cheated on me.,"Relationships,Marriage","It is completely understandable that you are struggling to forgive and forget this betrayal, and I'd like to echo the sentiment of Danielle Alvarez: infidelity takes time to heal from, so allow yourself to grieve and find the support you need. I'd highly suggest going to couples therapy and addressing all the issues that Danielle raised, especially whether he has expressed genuine remorse and is being completely transparent with you and is taking responsibility for the choice he made, including acknowledging the immense impact it had on you, your relationship, and your ability to trust him.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>If you have doubts about being able to trust him, he needs to be willing to earn back your trust and do whatever it takes to do so. If he accepts this challenge, then that is a good sign you are on the path toward healing your relationship. Also, please don't <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever </span>forget that regardless of what led him to cheat, it was his decision to take that action rather than addressing whatever issues he was having in your relationship. Couples affected by betrayal typically have some underlying issue(s), whether it is a lack of connection or intimacy or another factor, and it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is</span> possible to heal and grow even stronger as a couple after betrayal. Because you are grieving, though, allow yourself to acknowledge and accept your feelings of hurt and pain, as they will likely come in waves, but the pain will lessen over time and with supportive therapy, along with the commitment to repair your relationship-from both you and your husband.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, in regards to your concern about hurting your children, keep in mind that parents model healthy relationship behavior for their children. If your relationship with your husband remains disconnected, untrusting, or bitter, your children will see that and not only feel sad that their parents are both suffering, but also grow up feeling that experiencing such ongoing pain is tolerable or even normal in a relationship. Having parents who learn to handle conflict or heal deep wounds in healthy ways is crucial for children's emotional and psychological development. Whether they see you heal together as a married couple or heal separately as loving but divorced co-parents, they will learn what it is like to expect healthy communication and boundaries in relationships, which I'm sure you want for your children! Take care of yourself, and I wish you much peace and healing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, here is a good book I would recommend, along with books by Gottman, as Rebecca Wong suggested:</div><div><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Private-Lies-Infidelity-Betrayal-Intimacy/dp/0393307077"" target=""_blank"">Private Lies: Infidelity and the Betrayal of Intimacy</a><br></div>"
1140,How can I ask my boyfriend about who he's texting?,Relationships,"<p>Just ask him.</p><p>I'm not sure how you saw his phone if you're in a long distance relationship, because long distance means you live far apart from each other and don't get to see each other in person. Therefore, I think we may have a different understanding of the definition of ""long distance relationship"" which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you.</p><p>I don't know how old you are, but if you're an adult, after two and a half years, I don't think it's unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect. Long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you don't ever see each other in person. Talking, texting, and video chatting isn't enough, and the longer the physical distance remains, the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness. It may be time to evaluate the situation, figure out when (if ever) the two of you will be able to be together in person, and if you can and want to wait that long. Do you both want the same things out of life? If one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesn't, then it doesn't matter if it's long distance or not - if you aren't on the same page with the relationship, it is going to be difficult to make it work.</p><p>Trust is important. Issues with trust, insecurity, jealousy, lying and/or hiding things from each other, being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation - these things can ruin relationships if not addressed. I know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people, but it is necessary at times. Evaluate your true feelings for him. Are you with him for reasons other than love, such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldn't be able to find someone else? Has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before? Some people, unfortunately, develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them. However, if this is not the case, you may be unfairly judging his texting through the eyes of your own insecurities.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be time for you both to take an honest assessment of your own reasons for being in the relationship, figure out what you want, and make a decision. This may result in bringing the two of you closer and taking the relationship to the next level. Or, it could lead to a decision to end things. I know that can be difficult, but you both deserve to be happy and to be allowed to make the decisions that will lead to your personal happiness.</p>"
1141,How can I help my girlfriend?,"Relationships,Substance Abuse,Depression","<p>You're probably not going to like my answer.</p><p>Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.</p><p>Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.</p><p>You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.</p><p>Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.</p>"
1142,Overcoming fears.,"Anxiety,Behavioral Change","<p>Biologically, fear is designed to protect us from harm. Fear is not always a bad thing, and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>A phobia, however, is different. You used the term ""fear"" rather than ""phobia"". A phobia is an irrational fear - meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. If your situation is a phobia, exposure therapy can help. This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead, which may not always be feasible. If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life, then by all means, seek professional help to overcome it.</p><p>Everyone has fears, or things that make them nervous. Public speaking, asking a person out, fear of failure. Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. When you can get to the root cause of the fear, you can deal with that issue. A lot of times, it is a self-esteem issue. You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what's causing it and deal with the real issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Some fears are caused by trauma. Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into ""fight or flight"" mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn't notice or react to. In cases like this, exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear, I strongly urge you to seek a therapist - not just any therapist, but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims.</p>"
1143,I Sometimes I feel like I hate myself.,Self-esteem,"<p>The answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of times, these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. You internalize it and accept it as your reality.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. Even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood. Children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. The obvious, such as being abused, can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem, but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.</p><p>You may have never been physically or sexually abused, but what about emotionally? Were you yelled at, berated, put down? Were you told you'd never amount to anything? Were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short, couldn't live up to expectations? When you hear something over and over again, you start to believe it.</p><p>Maybe you weren't yelled at. Maybe it was the opposite. Studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. A chronically depressed mother, for example, may have seemed cold, detached, emotionless. She may have been less likely to show interest in a child's life, not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.&nbsp;</p><p>If one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up, chances are, a lot of the attention went to them, which could have led to your needs not being met.</p><p>Any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant, unheard, unloved, or like they don't matter.</p><p>Maybe nothing I've described here fits your situation. If you can't pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own, a counselor can help.</p><p>I am not saying ""blame it on your parents"" or telling you there's nothing you can do to change it! Quite the opposite! Understanding WHY you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the WHY. Then behavior - the HOW.&nbsp;</p>"
1144,What can I do about my dad?,"Family Conflict,Parenting","<p>Are you old enough to move out? Then by all means, what's stopping you?</p><p>If not, is it possible for you to move in with another family member?</p><p>If you're a minor, CPS may need to step in. They often do in cases of abuse. Your safety is the number one priority.</p><p>It's difficult to offer advice without knowing more about your situation. But I can say this: Don't let other people define your self worth. You can choose NOT to allow him to make you feel anything. It really is that simple. By looking at it as a choice you make, you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your self-worth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat you.</p><p>Let me say that again in a different way: Your self-worth is NOT defined by someone else. The way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person - not you. Don't take ownership of that!&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that if you are a minor, setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult. Reach out to others for help. But if you are 18 and over, there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment. Put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally. You owe it to yourself, and deserve to live a healthy, happy life. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong.</p>"
1145,Why do I always push my boyfriend away?,"Intimacy,Relationships","<p>I sympathize with you! It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other, and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is, there are ways to deal with this.</p><p>You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter one's sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this, talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control, such as condoms.</p><p>However, there are some other things to ask yourself. First, you used the term ""affection"" but then talked about sex. They're not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy, and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is ""The Five Love Languages"".</p><p>Defining what ""affection"" means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.</p><p>Humans are hard-wired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newborns/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don't receive this touch. It's called Kangaroo Care.&nbsp;</p><p>Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they're not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they're adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here.</p><p>For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual/physical touch (sexual abuse, physical beatings) it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.</p><p>Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if you've been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.</p><p>Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non-sexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don't even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other person's chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate.</p><p>If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples.</p>"
1146,Overcoming fears.,"Anxiety,Behavioral Change","<p>Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said ""I'm scared of snakes"", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in Manhattan</p><p>Hope that helps <br></p><p>C<br></p>"

validating the potential emotional pain you are feeling right now. There is
generally no lack of uncertainty, anxiety, fear, sadness, and anger. These are
all normal emotions and being allowed to feel them is the beginning of the
healing process. It might be helpful to talk about these feeling with your fiancé,
a friend or a counselor.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Now to get to your primary question.
Can a relationship move past infidelity? The short answer is yes. A bit longer
of an explanation is that is sounds like you and your fiancé had pieces of a solid
foundation to base a relationship on. For many couples they encounter a primary
challenge, sometimes that's money, or parenting and for some it's sexuality. If
you and your fiancé are both committed to balancing the positive aspects of your
relationship while improving the challenges than it's definitely possible to
move past this. This is not an easy process and for many couples takes months
or years of healing while engaging in relationship counseling.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;""><br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">Good luck to you and your continues

1152,Is it possible for a couple to overcome cheating if it only happened once?,"Intimacy,Relationships,Human Sexuality","<p>I think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question. &nbsp;I think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again? &nbsp;Once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. &nbsp;</p><p>First, if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the ""long haul"", so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again, that is completely do-able and possible if you both put in the work. &nbsp;But, there's a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. &nbsp;You say your relationship is ""good"", but there's been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. &nbsp;Would you agree with that, or what are your thoughts? &nbsp;Were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? &nbsp;If you are more of an emotional person than he is, you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn't been meeting your emotional needs. &nbsp;For instance, if you hadn't been feeling loved, cared about, validated, appreciated, cherished, and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. &nbsp;This is a common issue with couples, and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. &nbsp;In essence, many women tend to have more emotional needs than men, this is the way we are hard-wired, and there are exceptions to this of course, but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL! &nbsp;Until he understands this, and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally, you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally (and sexually). &nbsp;This leads to you both being frustrated, but if all this is ringing true to you, he seriously probably has no clue what's going on and may not know how you're feeling. &nbsp;You need to communicate your needs to him; if you are super lost with how to do that, there's an awesome book called The Five Love Languages. &nbsp;It's not that long, and it's very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening; really!!</p><p>This is a long post, I'm sorry! &nbsp;But this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. &nbsp;So back to the second direction you can go....you feel very betrayed, you aren't sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. &nbsp;For instance, if he says he is working late, or if he doesn't call or text right away when he usually does, you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. &nbsp;Of course, it may not be true, he may have legit reasons for his behaviors, but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia-mode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you, then the trust may not be able to be re-built. &nbsp;You need to think long and hard about this, and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty, then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. &nbsp;You can't just tell him vaguely ""I need to trust you again""; if he wants his family back and he's willing to do the work, you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. &nbsp;But, be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren't attracted to him anymore (or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren't meeting his physical needs)...if he throws that out there, but you weren't showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally, then it all starts with you communicating that to him. &nbsp;Get that book!</p><p>In conclusion, if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he's cheating when his behavior isn't spot on, you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. &nbsp;There is certainly a way to work through this, but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. &nbsp;Rebuilding trust can be a long process, maybe even years, and for some people, they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past. &nbsp;I truly recommend starting with the book, and then going from there. &nbsp;If you decide you want to stay with him, you would really benefit from couples counseling, as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again.</p>"

1156,Is it possible for a couple to overcome cheating if it only happened once?,"Intimacy,Relationships,Human Sexuality","<p>It's possible but challenging. Both partners need to be feel motivated enough to repair the relationship and dedicated to the work needed to address whatever underlying issues led to the serious breach of trust. For some people, cheating is an absolute deal breaker—for others, the context of the cheating allows them to see it as a mistake that they can forgive their partner for. So it depends on how you feel about the relationship and whether you want to put in the work to repair it.</p><p>If you're not sure how you feel, counseling can help you resolve the ambiguity, either individually or with your partner. Then, depending on what you decide, a counselor can help you either repair the relationship or decouple from your former partner.<br></p>"
1157,How can I find myself again?,"Self-esteem,Depression","<p>If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly ""lose yourself"" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. &nbsp;If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. &nbsp;Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to ""take care of everything"" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. &nbsp;You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. &nbsp;If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.</p><p>In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this ""self sacrifice at the expense of others"" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. &nbsp;Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. &nbsp;Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. &nbsp;Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. &nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. &nbsp;It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. &nbsp;Take one small step at at a time. &nbsp;Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching. &nbsp;Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food!<br></p>"
1158,How should I handle the child I had with my ex-wife?,"Parenting,Relationship Dissolution ","<p>You can ""move on and not live in the past"" in the context of your ex-relationship, but that does not mean moving on from your child. ""Moving on"" then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your ex-partner as far as is possible for the sake of your child's development.</p><p>Generally, it's good for a functional (non-abusive) parent to spend time with his/her child, but only insofar as that doesn't cause your child unnecessary stress. That requires the two adults to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">act</span> like adults with each other for the sake of their child.</p><p>What's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.</p><p>But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. If you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation. If that's not an option, then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules (for which you'd have to consult with an attorney).<br></p>"

If it's more than a 5/10, I would definitely recommend talking with a therapist in your area.</li><li>A lot of fears that we have come from something that at one time was self-protective and important. Do you know where your fear started? If you think it is still protecting you or helping you in some way, talk with someone (like a therapist) about it.</li><li>If it is something that you know is irrational (for example, fear of being hurt by static cling from winter clothing), is there some part of that that you are not afraid of?</li><li>I really encourage you to consider whether your fear has a lot of emotions connected to it or if it ties from something in your past that was very emotional for you at the time. If it does, consider working with a therapist to establish emotional safety before taking away the fear or anxiety that may actually be helpful to you.</li><li>Also, the fact that you notice that you are afraid of something and you don't want to be afraid of it anymore is a big step in the forward direction.</li></ul>"

1161,"How can I get ""out of my head"" and stop obsessive thoughts?",Behavioral Change,"<p>Hi there,</p><p>I first want to let you know that having these thoughts is completely normal. Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are ""negative"" so you are not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado, you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However, when you are, let's say, a mile away from a tornado, it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe.&nbsp;</p><p>When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise, we tend to start a ""war"" with them, which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them.&nbsp;</p><p>So the question I imagine you have is ""how do I get out of the tornado?"" There are 3 steps to doing this:</p><ol><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Get distance from your thoughts by adding ""I am noticing I'm having the thought that...."" to the front of them. For example, ""I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me.""&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The purpose of this is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span> to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don't get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that's okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance, you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. </span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Our 5 main emotions are: joy, sadness, fear/anxiety, shame, and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again, struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead, let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">more</span> intense.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Contact the present moment</span>. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear, see, taste, smell, and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths, what is happening with your heart rate, are you cold/warm, etc?</span></li></ol><div>Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">long run</span> is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope this helps!</div>"

1168,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hi there! Thank you for your question. It's a great question and one that many people want to know the answer to. The short answer is, YES! Counseling can be very helpful to people struggling with many different things. There has been a lot of research conducted to prove that counseling is an effective way to help people with mental health concerns, life stressors, and many other issues. In addition, there are many people who would tell you that counseling made a positive, profound impact on their lives. Indeed, some would tell you that counseling saved their lives. <br></p><p>Now, not everyone would tell you that counseling helped. But when you think about it, there are many medical treatments for a variety of healthcare issues that also do not help everyone. So, is counseling guaranteed? No. But, it is something that is worth trying if someone is suffering or is just wanting some perspective or support. Also, there is many different types of counseling. Different counselors have different styles and have different training for various issues. This means that you are likely to find someone who has a good style and expertise in an area that you want to work on. If you don't know where to go, I suggest contacting your state's counseling association. They can help. <br></p><p>I think the real question that most people have is, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">how</span>? How does it help? That question is a bit more complicated, because there are many different models of counseling/therapy that work in different ways. What I can tell you is that, regardless of the model of counseling, the relationship between counselor and client is the most important factor. I don't mean that the relationship has to be ooowy goowy... but it does have to be one where there is trust and openness. A counselor will spend time to make sure that you are working together as a team toward a common goal. If you go to counseling and you don't feel this is the case, tell your counselor. An ethical counselor will welcome your feedback. <br></p><p>I hope this is helpful, please ask more questions!

It's important to remember that there are different styles of therapy, some of which will work great with some, but poorly with others, specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. I often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice, in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals.&nbsp;<br><br>On a more specific note, there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours. &nbsp;However, medication is not an effective way of treating the problem, as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety, lowered mood, etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication.&nbsp;</p>"
1170,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>There are multiple ways that counseling helps people. The most basic is that it gives you someone to talk to about and through what you are facing. It is better than a friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and don't have to worry about the other side. This is also a place where you do not have to worry about how else the other person is involved in the situation. Beyond this basic level, a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people, including you, can effectively deal with this kind of situation. The counselor may also be aware of connections that you would not otherwise see. A good counselor will also recognize if and when you need other help or support in the situation. Why wouldn't you benefit from having someone walk with you in your journey to peace and wholeness.&nbsp;</p>"

1179,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hi! &nbsp;Great question. &nbsp;I believe counseling does help people! Of course, I am a therapist, so I would think that! :) &nbsp;Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves, our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent. &nbsp;Therapy can create opportunities to try new skills and enhance positive attributes that are already present in someone. &nbsp;I like to think of therapy as an unbiased ""aerial view"" of our lives. Someone outside can often help us notice things we might otherwise miss. Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>"
1180,Do I have to go to counseling to get hormones to transition from female to male?,LGBTQ,"<p>Hello! You've gotten some great answers here! &nbsp;I would like to add that transition looks different for everyone. For some folks, transition means hormones, surgery, voice work, electrolysis, and other medical interventions. For other individuals, it means some or none of that. &nbsp;It's an incredibly personal journey and only you (with the help of supportive individuals) can make those choices for yourself! Hope this helps! &nbsp;So glad you're reaching out for support! I would also add that you DO NOT need to enter therapy to receive hormones, if you have access to what is called an informed consent clinic. &nbsp;Informed consent clinics (at least in California) do not require letters or therapy as part of the process. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
1181,"How can I get ""out of my head"" and stop obsessive thoughts?",Behavioral Change,"<p>Such a great question! I'm so sorry you are struggling! You may be experiencing Intrusive thoughts. &nbsp;These are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us. &nbsp;I can strongly recommend a book called ""When Panic Attacks"" by Dr. David Burns. &nbsp;It helps you to identify the thoughts, and the help you create ways to counteract them! &nbsp;There is another technique, called Thought Stopping. Thought Stopping can be as simple as saying ""Stop!"" loudly (if you are alone) or in your head, if you are in public. &nbsp;It's a quick way to distract you from the distressing thought, and allow you to refocus. &nbsp;I recommend using this technique, followed by some deep breathing, while visualizing something that helps you feel relaxed (a favorite place, a pet, etc.). &nbsp;These three things in conjunction can be of great assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>One key component in addressing anxious thinking is building the skill of relaxation. &nbsp;I recommend an App called Headspace which teaches relaxation through some simple guided mediation. Super easy to do, and a great way to begin to build relaxation skills. &nbsp;</p><p>Plenty of sleep and reducing caffeine intake can also be things to explore. Hope this helps! &nbsp;</p>"

1183,Why can't I get an erection with my girlfriend?,"Human Sexuality,Intimacy","<p>Sexual desire seems to be straightforward - I like someone and I become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them - but that idea does not always take into account other factors.&nbsp;</p><p>Stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs. &nbsp;When we are overstressed, for example, we often find ourselves ill at the same time. &nbsp;Can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress? Additionally, focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate, which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection. &nbsp;While this may seem counter intuitive, it makes sense in the word of stress!</p><p>Finally, it's never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor, as well. You did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship, but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body, as well.&nbsp;</p>"
1184,How can I best fight the winter blues?,Depression,"<p>Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons, especially fall to winter. &nbsp;Everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels, increased isolation, etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently, there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:</p><p>1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. &nbsp;It's important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It's easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day, but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. &nbsp;Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights, complete with hot chocolate and a fire?</p><p>3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D. Light. &nbsp;These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies, as well as the release of growth hormone (which releases when we wake up). There are mixed reviews of these products, however, and they can be expensive.&nbsp;</p>"
1185,I need help coping with depression as a result of stress.,"Depression,Stress","<p>I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm.&nbsp;</p><p>From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. &nbsp;Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. &nbsp;When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? &nbsp;Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?</p><p>Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.</p>"
1186,How can I best fight the winter blues?,Depression,<p>Light therapy is very helpful. You are not alone. The name for the condition is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). You might want to see a therapist to assist you putting in place a behavioral program to help change the way you feel.</p>

Knowing your counselor is someone who is really on your side and wants to see you grow past your difficulties into a healthy, happy, successful life is more important than what kind of counseling method they use.

had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my
practice's focuses. &nbsp;The answer can depend upon several reasons all which
tend to be explored while in session. &nbsp;If you or your counselor utilizes
an integral approach, in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the
four irreducible perspectives (subjective, intersubjective, objective and
interobjective – also known as the four quadrants) in determining where the
challenges are, it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing
to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the
situation.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">In this case, from the upper-right
or behavioral and physical perspective, we would want to make sure there is no
physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor
and have the basics checked (such as blood pressure.&nbsp; We would also look at particular behaviors to
see if you are doing something with is effecting performance (such as
masturbating often or being influenced by pornography).&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">Next we would look at the
upper left quadrant (thoughts, cognitions, identity, feelings) to look at what
is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times.&nbsp; If you are worried about your job, your
family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate, this can
contribute to your situation.&nbsp; From there
we would turn to the lower left quadrant (cultural rules and tools) to see who
you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for
ways to shift, update and/or reshape the way you view sex and its
challenges.&nbsp; It would be here that we
would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based
upon how your family/culture of origin views the profession.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">Finally, we would need to
account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant (systems, laws,
rules of society) such as your economic ability to try services and products as
well as whether such services and products were even available.&nbsp; Once we have rolled through these areas it
then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at
further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just
getting a blood pressure medication is all you need.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10.5pt;"">To sum your question then
of why you can’t keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts (look
at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after), look at
your behaviors, look at your physical body for issues, look at where you picked
up your rules and tools (culture) and look at your ability to access goods and
services.&nbsp; They all contribute equally
and need to be taken into account.&nbsp; So - as you can see, there is no one possible answer to this, but several. &nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp;</span></p>"

It seems like since the ""winter blues"" happens to you every year it may also be impacting your quality of life and possibly relationships.

1194,How can I best fight the winter blues?,Depression,"<p>There can be lots of different factors contributing to this. Here are some possible tips:</p><ul><li>Consider if you know anything about what specifically is making you feel sad? If you're looking for activities because you cannot participate in what you like to do in the warmer months, consider finding some indoor winter activities</li><li>Connect with others. One idea is to join a group (such as a book club) that meets regularly. This could give you something to look forward to regardless of the colder weather.</li><li>Enjoy the sunshine from indoors. You may notice that sometimes looks are deceiving women is bright and sunny outside, but is also quite cold when you open the door. If you are staying inside for the day, consider allowing yourself to enjoy the sunlight without specifically considering that it is also cold.</li><li>Consider using a light box.

1201,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Counseling allows us to have a sacred space, a space that is set apart from the outside world, it is a space of non-judgement and exploration. Being that the universe is not made for us and that the the world tends to be a fairly untamed place at times, this sacred space allows us to explore ourselves. It allows for greater reflection upon our attitudes, our behaviors and our feelings. Imagine if you will a small goldfish swimming around the usual fish tank, although I dont attest to know what a goldfish thinks, I would imagine he does not see the world outside of him, he only sees the small fishbowl, oblivious to the outside world, when one comes into the counseling room, one is trying to gain insight that was not previously there. Remember the observer affect, one cannot truly act objectively with the world, we are in a dynamic relationship with life, it reacts to us and we to it, the time in the counseling room allows us to gain an understanding that is beyond the normal limits, allowing us to see what was before hidden, often times in plain sight.<br></p>"

If you can phrase it in such a way that they recognize that you are asking for information and not blaming them for not answering you, that could be effective.</p><p>I'd also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you. If it is causing a significant amount of anxiety (say, more than 5/10 if 10 is really anxious), I would suggest talking with a local therapist.</p><p>In the meantime, consider talking about this with someone you trust to whom you can get more details to get a more specific answer.</p>"
1203,How can I avoid family members who stress me out?,"Family Conflict,Stress","<p>It is understandable that it's very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece. You cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities, which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness. It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her. This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship, living situation, and the feeling of being ""abandoned.""&nbsp;</p><p>Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need, it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation. Nonetheless, it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>It is likely that your mother's ""complaints"" may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support. In this case, you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain, ""This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday. It's very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed. I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance."" When empathy and understanding is communicated, recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional help.</p><p>After sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help, the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you. This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother and/or niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed. This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally, taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite. You could then say to her if she complains again, ""I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is .........(explain what you could do to help).""</p><p><br></p><p>www.PsychologyResource.ca</p>"
1204,How can I get people to listen?,"Anxiety,Family Conflict,Depression,Stress,Social Relationships","<p>Teenage years are rough for anyone, and this is a time for self-discovery and experimentation. Having older parents can certainly pose challenges. Most kids feel like their parents don't understand them, but yours are older than the average parents of teenagers. They're from a completely different generation than you are. It sounds like they love you, but may not understand you. The problem here is the generation/age gap, and there's not a whole lot you can do about that. What you can do is accept the situation and perhaps look at it a little differently. It seems like you're looking for affirmation from them, looking for their approval and understanding. It's never a good idea to look to others to define who you are or to get a self-esteem boost. Who you are and how you feel about yourself needs to come from inside, not from outside. One way you can have a better relationship with your parents is to stop looking at all the things you aren't getting from them that you want, and rather look at all the things you are getting from them. Yes, this is a glass half full or half empty point of view, but it works. The negative will overshadow the positive if you let it. Start looking for the good things in your relationship with your parents and your feelings towards them will become more positive.</p><p>I'm not sure how your friends/peers made you feel like your childhood has been taken from you. That's a curious statement, and requires a deeper conversation to understand where that came from. However, I do understand feeling different and out of place, especially in high school. Find the strength within yourself rather than looking to others in your life to make you feel better or feel like a complete person.

This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety.  This takes a therapist trained in CBT.&nbsp;You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head, help you deal with the underlying cause of this, and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior. You'll learn coping skills.</span><br></p><p>You mention having a rough childhood. Anyone who has experienced trauma like this, especially long-term ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind, definitely does not need ""exposure therapy"", which is what is recommended for phobias. You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapy.</p><p>You are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is. Good luck with your healing journey!</p>"
1206,How do I get over a person I fell in love with?,"Relationship Dissolution ,Intimacy","<p>It's difficult to move on and let go, especially when you've experienced things for the first time with someone, or feelings you've never felt before, as you said.</p><p>I like the fact that you are looking at your situation ""logically"". &nbsp;Feelings can take time to fade, but you seem to understand, even if it is subconsciously, that it's the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him, not necessarily the person himself. Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person - the RIGHT person. Don't hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this. You're wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship - but with him necessarily? Or with anybody? You said you don't want to be without your love for him - not you don't want to be without him. In fact, you said you know you need to be without him. It seems like it's the LOVE that you can't let go of, and the feelings. Not the person. Trust me, you will find that again. Take some time to let this fade. Don't try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else. Cherish the memories and the experiences you had. Sounds like it's been a valuable learning and growth experience for you, but you have your own reasons, and I don't know what they are, for thinking this person isn't good for you. Trust your gut instinct and be glad you've had this relationship. Not all are meant to last. But all shape you into the person you are and will become, and all teach us important lessons.</p>"

No, I didn't write the book nor do I have any affiliation with it - I simply recommend it because it's a wonderful book and it helped me out a lot. I recommend it to a lot of people. It should be required reading!</p>"
1208,How can I make the voices stop?,Anxiety,"<p>This isn't something you can do on your own.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, you need to see a medical doctor ASAP to rule out medical causes for this. Many diseases, illnesses, and conditions can cause hallucinations. In the elderly, sometimes it's something as simple as a urinary tract infection. Some medicines may have that side effect as well.</p><p>However, you say you've been hearing them since you were little. I have no idea how old you are now, but something that has been going on for many years does lead me to think it could be a type of schizophrenia. A psychiatrist could diagnose that after taking a complete look at your history, medical history, etc. There are medications that they can put you on that will help.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that I find encouraging is that you recognize you're hearing voices. This means you are not so far into a delusion as to believe it is real. A lot of people that hear or see things that aren't there are not able to have the awareness that these things are not real. They fully believe what they're hearing/seeing. It's completely real to them. Because you have the awareness that you do, I feel this is a very good sign that with treatment you can live a normal life (assuming you are not already receiving treatment for it. If you are and are still hearing the voices, please know that medications often need to be changed and adjusted, and the voices may never completely go away but medicines certainly help dull them a lot. Always talk to your doctor when it seems your symptoms are getting worse so that they can make the necessary medication adjustments for you).</p><p>If at any time the voices are telling you to do something, please go to an ER as this is an emergency. Sometimes people hear voices telling them to harm themselves, harm someone else, or do other things that are against the law. Do not try to deal with something like that on your own. There are people who can help.</p>"
1209,I don't know how to communicate with my adult daughter.,"Family Conflict,Relationships,Parenting","<p>1. She's an adult.</p><p>2. She lives in your house? She follows your rules.</p><p>3. What you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.</p><p>4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"". You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult - treat her like one. Maybe then she'll act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a ""but..."" and then explain all the reasons why you can't tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because that's what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices - you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents' lives are focused around them (some more than others) and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldn't want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is ""the right thing"" but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking - the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices.&nbsp;</p>"
1210,Can I sign my brother into a mental health facility?,"Family Conflict,Legal & Regulatory,Substance Abuse","<p>Family members sometimes get Power of Attorney over vulnerable adults. If you had this, you could do something like that. I'm assuming that you don't, though. There are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed, but it is a long process.&nbsp;</p><p>I deal with situations like this everyday on the job. The only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor (such as at an emergency room) to be a threat to self or others. For instance, if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action, or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out, he could be placed on a short hold, but these holds only last for a few days. This still isn't a long-term solution.&nbsp;</p><p>An adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices, no matter how bad those choices are. If you have a way to get him to an ER whenever things like that happen, such as being found sleeping outside in 12 degree weather, it will help a lot. They may or may not do a short term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the ER, but it's a start. They can help set him up with appointments for psych and he can get on medications. You can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled. However, you can't force him to take the meds, so this may be something that happens a lot. With enough of a paper trail of many ER visits and that sort of thing, you'll stand a better chance of getting a court appointed psych ward stay.&nbsp;</p><p>Some tips about ER visits: Don't send him alone. Always go with him or have someone go with him, because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into what's going on than he will. He may say everything's fine and he wants to leave, so they won't have any reason to keep him if that is the case. Go with him.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do get Power of Attorney, take the paperwork with you when you go to the ER and to doctor's appointments because they aren't just going to take your word. They need to see the actual paperwork. Having it on file in their system isn't good enough because paperwork expires, etc. Take it with you at all times. You can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of what's going on.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you do get Power of Attorney, this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him. Otherwise, you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect. In fact, your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help. She won't be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills, but should be held responsible for his safety. Someone should. There are group homes for people with schizophrenia. "" Being responsible"" for someone doesn't mean you have to pay their bills, it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need. That care may be placement in a long-term care facility like a group home or a nursing home. Psych inpatient hospitals aren't long-term, so you do need to look into other long-term options. Psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him, they're not where someone stays forever.</p><p>Good luck, and keep up the good attitude! Work with his treatment team. Ask for a social worker. If they see family that is wanting to do the right thing and wanting to help, they'll help you even if it does take a while to get things sorted out. The worst thing any of you can do is NOT go to appointments and that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>"
1211,Is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend?,"Intimacy,Relationships","<p>No, that's perfectly normal. You're under 18, too. You're only a year older than she is. This is absolutely normal. What would be wrong is if you did anything to her against her will. Always remember that NO means NO, respect her, respect yourself, and be a normal teenager! Have a healthy relationship. Holding hands, kissing, and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it. Although it is frowned upon by a lot of people, it's no secret that teenagers do have sex (even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it). Only you can make the choice that is right for you. Just be responsible in the choices you make. Some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex. You'd be surprised how young those ages are. A 14 year old having sex with a 20 year old would be against the law, but someone the same age as her, or just one year older is not. ""Wrong"" can be defined in a lot of different ways, though. Is it against the law? No. Is it against your religion? I can't answer that for you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can, however, have a relationship that is not physical in any way. It's okay to just be with her and enjoy her company. You can hang out, watch movies together, go on dates, do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing. Your relationship can be anything you want it to be.&nbsp;</p>"

While forgetting is probably the hardest part, forgiveness is something that can and will happen. There are things you can do to help yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>The first this is identifying what you feel is best for yourself and your children.

A specific breakdown of what benefits come with staying and what are the ramifications. Vice-versa for leaving. Include your partner. I think being honest with him and letting him know what you are thinking is could be a great option. At least you aren't keeping something inside yourself to manage. Rather, you are being transparent to them. Sometimes a couple can come to an agreement that it may be time to end things and other times it may be best to keep moving forward with a serious plan to how to move forward. Regardless, if you can't trust him and that feeling will never go away it's time to address it.

1219,Is it possible for a couple to overcome cheating if it only happened once?,"Intimacy,Relationships,Human Sexuality","<p>Hello. Thank you for your question. Many couples that experience infidelity in their relationship face this important question - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""is it possible for us to get past the cheating, or should I just move on?""</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Deciding to stay or leave is such a personal decision, one that only you can make.</p><p>When an affair is disclosed or found out, it can have a traumatic impact on the betrayed partner. The betrayed partner might be overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts - Wanting answers to specific questions - Wanting details. And the partner that had the affair might be feeling overwhelm around ""Will their partner ever forgive them?"" ""Will they trust them again?"" ""How long will it take to regain their trust again?""&nbsp;</p><p>While it is possible for couples to get past the cheating, it does take a commitment from each partner to do the work needed. Because of the complexities cheating has on the bond couples have with each other, I would recommend seeing a couple therapist that specializes in working with the issue of infidelity. When infidelity happens, there are usually a number of secrets that accompany it, and this can be incredibly difficult for couples to work through on their own.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

Sometimes there are motivations for having an affair that can be discussed in therapy in a way that you become more aware of what each other is experiencing and where you want to go from here. It could be that learning to communicate differently would be helpful.</p><p>Regarding whether you should ""just move on,"" I recommend talking about with a therapist as well.

1223,How can I get people to listen?,"Anxiety,Family Conflict,Depression,Stress,Social Relationships","<p>One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others, especially parents, do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you, it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. </p><p>I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard.&nbsp;Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words, do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as ""you NEVER listen,"" ""you ALWAYS say..."" and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with ""you"" try using ""I"" by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally, let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.</p><p>I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist, teacher, or school counselor if possible.&nbsp;Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.</p><p>Best of luck to you.</p>"

1226,How can I make the voices stop?,Anxiety,"<p>First, let me express my support and compassion for what you're going through. Hearing voices can be incredibly difficult and can feel like you can't get a moment's peace, even in the privacy of your own mind. And not everyone will necessarily understand what you're dealing with, so I imagine you may also be feeling isolated or somehow different. Atta girl/boy on reaching out for help!&nbsp;</p><p>Many people find benefit to taking medications, such as risperdal, seroquel, and so on. These should be prescribed by a nurse practitioner or psychiatrist -- I do not recommend a primary care doctor venture into this area, as a general rule. Discuss the options thoroughly and insist on a good rapport with your prescriber, if you decide to go this route.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people are having results with a talk-therapist to develop coping strategies. There is a new and somewhat less conventional approach to challenging voices with a professional to assist you, rather than to suppress the voices, which medication will do. There is peer-run organization and a general approach that attempts to live with voices in a different way. &nbsp;You can read about it in Living With Voices by Marius Romme. I have heard interviews but have not read the book(s) and can't speak to its efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter what steps you decide to try, managing your stress, sleep, exercise, healthy food is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">essential</span> -- in other words, just the daily care and feeding of yourself should be included in all of your efforts and bears surprising benefits to your brain and emotional health.&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes to you,</p><p>Karen Keys, LMHC, CASAC</p>"
1227,How do I deal with my alcoholic boyfriend with a dark past?,"Anger Management,Relationships,Substance Abuse,Addiction","<p>First, let me extend my compassion to both of you -- it sounds like you have a lot on your plates. Childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us.&nbsp;</p><p>Your question is brief, so I'll just try to give general answers as best I can. From my experiences treating many people with your boyfriend's experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you can't fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. He needs a professional. Period.&nbsp;</p><p>What you <span style=""font-style: italic;"">can</span>&nbsp;do, is take care of yourself. With his background, it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. Your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. Trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, manage his own emotions and behaviors. So your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the near-term, certainly not without professional help. You might also benefit from help and support, to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. I am NOT blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriend's behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. If you have accepted your boyfriend's drinking and violent outbursts in the past (by staying in the relationship), that is likely to perpetuate his behavior. And there isn't any way to ""handle violent outbursts."" They shouldn't be handled at all, and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>We can never really change anyone else. The only person we can change is ourselves. Sometimes our behavior changes the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">odds</span> of another person's behaviors, but it doesn't control it. I would recommend that you work with a professional to first, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ensure your own safety above all</span>. Then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and which you want to separate from. Whatever your boyfriend does in his life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. Let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery.&nbsp;</p>"
1228,Can I sign my brother into a mental health facility?,"Family Conflict,Legal & Regulatory,Substance Abuse","<p>Hello, My heart goes out to you, your brother, and your family, dealing with a very painful and difficult situation.&nbsp;</p><p>In New York, you can't institutionalize someone else directly. You can, however, call the police or EMS. If they agree that he would benefit from hospitalization (and it sounds like they would), he can be held in the hospital for up to 72 hours, whether he agrees or not. Some hospitals will not hold a person that long, in spite of what we might want. I have seen many patients in and out of hospitals countless times, and it has been my experience that it can be extremely difficult to hold a person long enough to achieve good stability and an appropriate after-care plan. Hospitals in NYC tend to take a ""patch and release"" approach more often than I would like.&nbsp;</p><p>It's been my experience that family makes a difference. Assertive, knowledgeable, persistent family can improve the quality of your loved one's care. Hospitals are highly pressured to discharge people quickly but they can not discharge a homeless person without someplace to go. If your family is willing to accept your brother, that will be the path of least resistance for the hospital. If the family refuses, they will be forced to find another path for him. You can also pressure the hospital to refer to rehab after psychiatrically stablized (which may only take a few days) and that may give your brother more time to begin making clear-headed decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>If your brother has a psychiatrist, that person should be actively involved. I had a patient patched-and-released three times, in spite of my advocacy and him literally <span style=""font-style: italic;"">begging</span>&nbsp;to remain and stop his voices. We finally got a 90 day hospitalization because I strong-armed his psychiatrist into demanding that the hospital stabilize his patient. &nbsp;</p><p>If your brother has a history of non--compliance with oral medications, you can push the hospital for injection, which again will help your brother stay stable for longer.&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes to you and your family.&nbsp;</p>"
1229,How do I help my husband get over his drinking addiction?,Addiction,"<div>It's not easy to be married to an alcoholic and I want to extend my support to you. &nbsp;Without knowing the pattern of his substance use, I'll accept your description that he is an addict.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The short version is that his addiction is not in your hands. Period. However, addiction is a ""family disease"", so you are definitely connected to it. Most people benefit from professional help, whether they are the addict or the other person. You might read some material from al-anon to improve your insight into how addiction works within relationships. It is safe to say that you are likely to have a role as a ""co-dependent"" or ""enabler"". The most common pattern is doing overt and subtle things that insulate the addict from the consequences of their behaviors. From calling out sick for the person when they're hung-over to allowing money to pay for alcohol, to simply remaining in the relationship, these are all behaviors that make the addiction more likely to continue.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Change is difficult for all of us, especially when a physical dependency on a substance may be involved. But the awkward truth is that not one of us ever made a change unless we were in at least some pain. Pain in our present circumstance is a requirement to achieve change. By ""enabling"" your husband, you minimize that pain. Let me state again, though, that his addiction is not in your control and it's not for you to fix. You can, however, change your own behaviors in ways that might change his odds. Even if he does not get over his drinking addiction, as a general rule, you will be happier if you stop being a participant in it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Many people find that an addiction removes the addict from the relationship -- they're not really there, even if they appear to be. At the same time, there's a third person -- the substance. Some people choose not to remain in a relationship that's constructed in this odd and off-balance way.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope that gives you some thought-starters but I would encourage you to seek in-person help from a local provider. And I wish for you and your husband recovery and well-being. Best regards,</div><div>Karen Keys, LMHC, CASAC</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>"
1230,I feel stuck in life. What can I do?,"Relationships,Family Conflict,Parenting,Stress",<p>I would want to know where do you put your needs? Often times we show people how to treat us based on how we treat ourselves. First identify how to practice good self care which can only happen when you are authentic and real about your needs and desires. You cannot pour from an empty cup and must take find the time to explore your purpose in life. It may be helpful to seek out additional support to work on your intrapersonal relationship.&nbsp;</p>
1231,How can I avoid family members who stress me out?,"Family Conflict,Stress","<p>It is difficult to implement healthy boundaries when the person is a parent or family member. I would encourage you to identify how it makes you feel after talking with your mother. Work on establishing healthy boundaries where you do not feel obligated to engage the complaining daily. Maybe setting a time limit to talk with your <span style=""-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"">mother and practicing how to be assertive and not disrespect or aggressive. Helping your mother understand how you feel using &nbsp;""I"" statements &nbsp;i.e &nbsp;( I feel _____ when you call to talk about my sister). Maybe asking your mom how can you be supportive of her during this time other than listening to her vent. It may also be helpful for your mother to get connected with support groups to help her cope with this life change.&nbsp;</span></p>"
1232,How can I best fight the winter blues?,Depression,"<p>Seasonal depression can be difficult due to the weather being a primary trigger. Understanding that we have very little control over the weather, therefore we can focus on the things we can change. Exercising, meditation, guided imagery, and deep breathing can be beneficial to combat seasonal depression. It may help to join a support group and seek out therapy to assist you on this healing journey.</p>"
1233,How do I move on?,Relationship Dissolution ,"<p>The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal. &nbsp;That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact. &nbsp;In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings. &nbsp;Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.</p><p>Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different. &nbsp;The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns. &nbsp;Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself. &nbsp;<br></p>"
1234,How do I handle being wanted in a relationship when I'm used to feeling unwanted?,"Self-esteem,Relationships","<p>Hi! Thank you for your question. It's tough to be in a healthy and loving relationship when we believe we are not worth it. Quite often being in such a relationship is very uncomfortable as it goes against everything we believe about ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>First, I want to say you are very brave to open up yourself to the relationship with this wonderful woman you met.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, I would like to invite you to treat yourself with compassion as you are entering this unknown territory for yourself. Doing something new and totally unfamiliar can be scary, so it's vital that you are kind and gentle with yourself. Acknowledge that what you are doing is scary and uncomfortable and that it will take some time to get used to it.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't judge yourself and force yourself to feel a certain way. It's important that you are patient with yourself and tolerant of your discomfort. With time, space, kindness, and tolerance your discomfort and fear will start to dissolve. Invite your new partner to also relate to your feelings in the open and compassionate way.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The worst thing that you or your partner can do is to rush your feelings, pressure you to feel in a different way or to say that there is something wrong with you cause you feel a certain way. Please be gentle with yourself and celebrate and acknowledge every small victory. Every time you do something little, like holding hands or receive a compliment and it no longer scares you as it did a week ago - celebrate that progress!&nbsp;</p>"
1235,PTSD is impacting my whole life.,Trauma,"<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>I hear you, PTSD has a very&nbsp;debilitating effect on your whole life. I know that from personal experience. Recovering from it is possible and doable!&nbsp;</p><p>First is step is to acknowledge to yourself that your PTSD symptoms are a normal reaction to an abnormal and traumatic event. The nightmares, the anxiety, the heightened startle response - are all typical human responses following exposure to a frightening event. It's important that you don't blame yourself or your body for reacting this way, rather approach yourself with&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;and kindness that you would extend a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;who is hurting.&nbsp;</p><p>The second&nbsp;step is to start taking steps towards healing. I would really encourage you to see a counselor or therapist specializing in trauma recovery so that you have a guided, step by step support. But if this is not an option, you can begin your healing on your own using a step-by-step approach outlined in the book,<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Healing-Trauma-Pioneering-Program-Restoring/dp/159179658X""> Healing Trauma, by Peter Levin</a>. It's a very hands-on book and even comes with a CD audio guide. It has concrete exercises that you can do to help you eliminate dissociation, feel grounded, and decrease your anxiety response. I have used myself and with my clients with great success!&nbsp;</p><p>You can begin your recovery journey now with this video with Peter Levin's approach to Trauma Recovery:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmJDkzDMllc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmJDkzDMllc</a></p><p>One last thing, I suggest consulting with a nutritionist or a doctor to help you boost your healing with supplements, vitamins, and minerals. The stress from PTSD is very draining on the body, and you use up a lot of energy and resources, so at times of trauma supplements are quite necessary for recovery (Magnesium, Omega 3, Zinc, Vitamin C....etc)</p>"
1236,How can I avoid family members who stress me out?,"Family Conflict,Stress","<p>This sounds like a possible boundary issue. Boundaries are important in relationships. They are invisible lines that we will or will not cross. It is up to us to create and hold them. We have the ability to rethink them and change them as needed. It sounds like you have thought it through and would like to makes changes in the relationship between your mother and you. In the main question, you want to avoid the family member, however in the following comment, it sounds like you may just want the avoid that conversation, not so much your mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we review the issue and decide what we need (create the boundary), I suggest opening talking with the person when everyone is calm (not in the middle of a stressful moment when we often are unable to focus and hear the other person). Always understanding that we had time to think about this issue and the other person has not (catching them off guard). State clearly your need. Such as ""I am not comfortable with hearing about my sister. It stresses me out. I would appreciate it if you would not bring it up anymore. If you do, I will not respond and I will change the subject "" It is important to use ""I"" statements. I feel"" this way"". I will ""do this"". We only have power over our actions. Also when we use ""you "" comments, the other person can become defensive and unable to hear what we are saying.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we let ourselves know what we need, then let the other people know our new boundary, then it is up to us to follow through. We will make mistakes. Not follow through every time with our boundary. That is okay. Start again. It gets easier with practice. It is also appropriate to reconsider and change your boundary as needed. Just let the others know when you need to change it. Remember, they can not read our minds.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish you much strength and hope the best for you and your family.</p><p>www.parishhealthandwellness.com</p>"
1237,I over endulge when I drink alcohol and feel extremely guilty about it the next day.,"Substance Abuse,Social Relationships","<p>Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" You might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. &nbsp;</p><p>One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">disease of avoidance</span>. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.&nbsp;</p><p>I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness.&nbsp;</p>"
1238,How should I handle the child I had with my ex-wife?,"Parenting,Relationship Dissolution ","<p>You're in a difficult situation and on behalf of you and your child, I commend you for trying to find the right thing to do.</p><p>Short version: your child needs you as much as possible. period. Always. We used to think that children were almost always harmed by divorce, unless there was extreme conflict or violence. More recent data shows that children are not necessarily harmed by divorce <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">if they keep both their parents. </span>In other words, the damaging part is losing half of themselves and losing the value of being connected to everyone who loves them, especially the other parent, in addition to the extra benefit there is from the other parent's perspective, strengths and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>The best thing for your child is for you to be available and loving and doing everything possible to allow the child to be whole - a person who incorporates BOTH parents. It's a tragedy for everyone to use a child to achieve adult aims, like getting back at a former spouse. In such a circumstance, your child needs you more than ever. If you and your wife have different rules and so on, your child will learn to adjust and adapt, just as they would if you remained in the household. A child quickly learns that they talk to mom about x,y,z or get away with whatever, but has different rules with dad. He/she will not be too confused in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>Please stay the course in dealing with a difficult ex-wife for you and your child's wellbeing. Best of luck to all.</p>"
1239,My parents are getting a divorce and I feel depressed.,"Relationship Dissolution ,Depression","<p>It sounds like a tough time and it's normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship. There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck.&nbsp;</p><p>Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--<span style=""font-style: italic;"">even when you don't feel like it--</span>&nbsp;healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression, &nbsp;work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support.

Congratulations!</p><p>I often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem. We often seem to blame ourselves for not ""loving ourselves"" enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem. It seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact, need each other for our survival, we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment. In other words, you can't just snap your fingers and voila! now I love myself, where there was an empty space or self-doubt before. We grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us. &nbsp;</p><p>Allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship. You are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world. What a marvelous gift for you!&nbsp;</p><p>You may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable. These fears of loss may get in your way, however understandable. If you are truly close to your companion, you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it.

1244,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Everyone has different experiences going to therapy. Being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel. Emotions are our body's way of telling us important information about ourselves. I would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this. That way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor. There are probably underlining emotions (fears or insecurities) that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions. Your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety. In individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors. As you address your issues, then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship.&nbsp;</p>"
1245,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your question. It's absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share.&nbsp;</p><p>And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.&nbsp;</p>"

Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people's life, but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple.&nbsp;</p><p>The first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband. It's important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example, asking your husband how often does he want to have sex/ week or /month. When having this conversation, it's important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem, yet.&nbsp;</p><p>There are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic/friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page - lack of sex might not be a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>If there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire, I would recommend seeing a professional relationship &amp; sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic, what's creating it, what's getting in a way of connecting sexually and to&nbsp;assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions.&nbsp;</p>"
1247,How do I move on?,Relationship Dissolution ,"<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p><p>Break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It's important that you don't compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, &amp; vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that's what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That's exactly the same when it comes to emotional&nbsp;pain. Take care of yourself, keep&nbsp;yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.&nbsp;</p><p>3. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind.""&nbsp;</p><p>4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.&nbsp;</p><p>5. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset&nbsp;and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>6. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.&nbsp;</p>"
1248,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>""Normal"" can be an insidious word to use because it can undermine your sense of worth. &nbsp;It implies there's one particular way you should be behaving and can leave you feeling crappy and ""abnormal"" if you're not behaving according to that prescribed standard. &nbsp;</p><p>Instead, what I'd recommend is to pay attention to your emotional experiences when you're attending therapy. &nbsp;Explore your feelings and thoughts without judgement and try to reflect and understand what's going on that's causing you anxiety. &nbsp;Once you figure out the underlying meaning of the anxiety, you can figure out a way to handle it and action steps to take to diminish it. &nbsp;</p>"

1254,I'm attracted to my boss.,"Relationships,Workplace Relationships",<p>There are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational well-being so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace. &nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesn't mean it's a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace. &nbsp;</p>
1255,How can I get people to listen?,"Anxiety,Family Conflict,Depression,Stress,Social Relationships","<p>I'm sorry you feel so alone and isolated, those feelings in and of themselves can lead to depression, stress and anxiety. &nbsp;So job one is finding someone you can talk to. &nbsp;A good friend or an open parent can be as helpful as a professional counselor, but if you don't have those, then by all means call your local Mental Health Association, suicide prevention, or go see your school counseling department. There are many of us now who do on-line, FaceTime, phone counseling so that is an option to consider in your situation. &nbsp;On the other hand, &nbsp;If you want to script a conversation with your parents (I'm a great believer in scripting) not that you're going to read it to them, but if you write down exactly what you want to say, read it over a few times before you're ready to have the conversation. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;You'll be much more likely to do it if you're prepared, and you'll &nbsp;have a better chance of saying everything you want to say in a calm but forceful way. &nbsp;The same with your friends--you are probably a great listener and therefore attract people who want to talk--so you need to let these friends know you need something in return. &nbsp;If you practice asking for equal talk time, then perhaps these friends will respond and surprise you, or if you make those demands you'll start attracting people who are looking for equality in friendships. &nbsp;Now back to that script--first decide do you want to talk to both parents at once, or one at a time. &nbsp;Then begin to write down the points you want to make such as: &nbsp; I love you, and I know you love me but I don't feel as though I can trust your love to be unconditional enough to tell you who I really am, and how I really feel. &nbsp;Find your own words to describe your own feelings. &nbsp;If I can help, get in touch.

They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. </p><p>There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,&nbsp;your continued &nbsp;dedication and motivation will take you far. </p><p>I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that &nbsp;that you feel nervous and shaky.

If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. </p><p>If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are&nbsp;incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we&nbsp; are feeling anxious. </p><p>You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. Wishing you the very best!</p><p>Laura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

1266,How can I help my fiancé accept and let go of my past?,"Relationships,Intimacy,Spirituality","<p>One of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself, but you can't make goals for your partner. If your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction, you can certainly assist him, but you can't independently make it happen.</p><p>I wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five, 10, 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change, but just listening (kind of like an investigative reporter) so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean, when it feels like to to him when this is discussed, etc. At that point, maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as well.</p><p>Also, if he wants to make a change, it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples.

1267,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Well, it's generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going into therapy, particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through, much less to someone who you don't know well, can be anxiety-producing. It's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.</p><p>The most important thing I can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. Personally, I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.</p><p>Thanks for writing here.

1268,How do I get my husband to listen to me?,"Relationships,Marriage","<p>Thanks for writing. There are many different house of things that may be helpful here. I can give you some general ideas, but if some of these things don't get you to where you would like to go, consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples:</p><ul><li>Remember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. You can ask him to make changes, but you can't control whether he does or not. You can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts, feelings, and actions in the relationship.</li><li>If you're going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen, first ask whether this is a good time.</li><li>Try to talk to him without blaming, finger-pointing, or asking him to change (this can be difficult, but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussions).</li><li>Be mindful of your packaging. By that, I mean that you may have a very important message that you're trying to get across. If you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what you're actually saying, that is helpful. If you are talking in ways that are angry, or as I sometimes say, wrapped in spikes, that can be difficult to hear and receive. Rather than hearing what you're actually trying to get across, he may just hear the fact that you are angry.</li><li>If your husband is able to listen to you and/or restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right, let him know what that feels like to you and how important it is.</li><li>If you're asking questions, try to avoid ""why"" question and use ""what makes, how, when, where, who"" instead. Questions starting with ""why"" can not only be difficult to answer, but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right away.</li><li>Also, keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement. This may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband – just because he is hearing what you're saying doesn't mean that he's agreeing with you.</li><li>Lastly, but importantly, some people really don't know how to listen effectively. There are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives. Sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerability-producing. It may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that he's really struggling.</li></ul>"

1274,How do I get my husband to listen to me?,"Relationships,Marriage","<p>Unfortunately you can't directly change another person's behavior. However, you can give him feedback on how his not listening impacts you. The best way to provide feedback is in 3 parts. The first part is telling him the emotion you are experiencing when he doesn't listen, such as hurt, sad, and unloved. I would stay away from feelings such as frustrated, angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion. The second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way, be specific! Example: when I get home and tell you about my day and you don't look away from the tv. Be objective as possible when you describe his behavior. And the last part is the most important, tell him what you want him to do, and again be specific! Example: I would rather you turn off the tv, give me eye contact and reassure me about my day. Here is an example with all 3 parts together: I feel hurt when you don't say anything to me when I tell you about my fight with my friend, I want you to hug me and tell me you understand how I feel. Hope that helps!!</p>"
1275,Is being mean and fighting with my boyfriend normal after an abortion?,"Grief and Loss,Relationships","<p><p>Yes, it is completely normal to experience a wide range of emotions after a major loss. Healing can occur in stages. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross proposed the concept of the five stages of grief:</p></p><ol><li>Denial - Unable to believe the reality of the loss.</li><li>Anger - Wanting to blame somebody or something, having thoughts like ""this isn't fair!"" and ""why me?""</li><li>Bargaining - Hope that you can somehow avoid the cause of grief with a promise to compromise or change.</li><li>Depression - Feeling sad, discouraged, and/or hopeless.</li><li>Acceptance - Being able to remember with love rather than pain.</li></ol><p>The stages are not linear and not everyone experiences all five stages in this order. This 5-stage model is meant to help normalize the grieving process and educate individuals that you have to let yourself feel your way through your grief. It can help to work with a trained professional counselor to guide and support you on your path to healing. ​​</p>"
1276,What makes my husband so selfish when it comes to my feelings?,Marriage,"<p>It sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband. &nbsp;Your perceptions of interactions that you are having don't sound like they match up. &nbsp;It would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using ""I"" statements (I feel----when you---). &nbsp;This is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person. &nbsp;If you work on communicating in new, less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouse's feelings and perspective. &nbsp;</p>"
1277,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>If you have only been to a couple of sessions, it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first. Therapy is hard work! You may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before. Opening up to stranger can be scary. After you feel comfortable with your counselor, and trust has built up and you feel understood in session, you should feel more relaxed. I would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. Sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. If you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions, it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from. For example, are you and the therapist not a good fit? But, again if you are just starting out in working together, feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense, and I encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling.</p>"

I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.</p><p>Feeling ""unhappy and trapped"" may also mean that you are &nbsp;believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true. &nbsp;Is it really true that you trapped? You also said that you have an amazing life. It doesn't sound like you are only having negative thoughts. You have some positive ones, too. However, you are giving a lot of weight to the negative thoughts, more weight than the positive ones.</p><p>I also wonder if you are struggling with the fact that you are even having this thought. One thing that can be helpful is to recognize that you are having a thought, that it is a negative thought, that thinking it does not make it true, and to let it go. This is the basis for mindfulness work that can be really helpful. It is a great place for you to start so you can balance out your thoughts and emotions.</p><p>Best of luck to you!</p>"
1279,How can I help my fiancé accept and let go of my past?,"Relationships,Intimacy,Spirituality","<p>Sometimes we have difficulty keeping the past in the past. The best way to build a great relationship and have a great future, believe it or not, is to be firmly placed in the present. That means that when we stay in the moment with our partner and can notice what we are experiencing in the here and now we reap the best benefits of that relationship. We notice the good things that are happening in the moment. We are reacting to what we are experiencing in the moment, not reacting to a worry about the past. We notice, especially, who the person is right now and not who they were in the past. &nbsp;We can connect with the things we love about them, too.<br><br>I think it is great that you want to help him and the choice to stay in the present and move forward in the relationship will mostly be up to him. We cannot change another person. It sounds like couples counseling might be a great step for you because you can both learn the skills you need to stay in the present and also learn some helpful ""active listening"" skills so that you can really listen to one another and understand each other. Communication skills can really be helpful. You can both have the opportunity to hear each other and support each other. We cannot change the past, but we can create the future we want.</p><p>Best of luck to you both!&nbsp;<br></p>"

I highly recommend working with a mental health professional who has experience working around the issue of infidelity. Together, you can work on healing the wounds and moving forward.

1290,How do I get my husband to listen to me?,"Relationships,Marriage","<p>It's hard when you feel as if you're the only one that's taking the time to listen to your spouse. But, I would look at this as an opportunity to see if you can become aware of what exactly is happening between you, when you try and talk with your husband.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, it can be in the way dialogue is approached. I would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband. See if blame and criticism are present. When blame and criticism are included, bids for connection, can quickly go off track. This can sometimes start off with something like: ""why don't you..."" ""you aren't..."" ""you don't..."" Partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack. &nbsp;</p><p>Also, become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband. Sometimes, this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another. &nbsp;</p><p>If you find this pattern continues, you might consider seeking professional help through couples therapy. A trained couples therapist can help you both understand more about what's happening between you.&nbsp;</p>"
1291,I feel completely alone in my marriage.,"Marriage,Relationships,Intimacy","<p>Feeling alone in your marriage is one of the most painful feelings. Wanting connection with your spouse yet feeling the all too familiar distance that's keeping you apart can be so hurtful. But, change is possible. You might be able to move closer toward each other on your own but since there has been two years of distance, I would suggest looking into couples therapy with a trained couples therapist. They are trained in helping couples begin to examine what's been happening that has caused a drift in your marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also curious if there was a significant event that occurred around the time you started feeling distant. If there was something that occurred during this time that is hard for you both to talk about, couples therapy can help with this also. It can provide a safe and supportive space for you both.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
1292,How do I move on?,Relationship Dissolution ,"<p>Dealing with a breakup is difficult. We have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. First, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. If we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. So in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. Instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. The second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. You might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. When we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. Lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. This is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. If you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning. I hope this helps. Take good care of yourself!&nbsp;</p>"

1299,How can my marriage be fixed?,Marriage,"<p>One key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. When couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? If you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - <span style=""font-style: italic;"">when things are good between you</span> - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. That way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. Rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.&nbsp;</p>"
1300,How should I handle the child I had with my ex-wife?,"Parenting,Relationship Dissolution ","<p>I am really glad you reached out. When parents get divorced, they still need to figure out how to have relationship so that they can parent their child. We might divorce our partners, however, we don't divorce our children. If anything our children need to know that we are still a stable force in their lives. Unfortunately, in some relationships children get used as a bargaining piece and I am hearing that may be happening in your relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>You can move on from the relationship with your ex while still maintaining a relationship with your child. It is possible and it takes both parents to agree to do the right thing by their child. It is important for your children to have some consistency in his or her time with you. For example, if you and your ex don't have a parenting schedule it is something that you want to create so that you can not only decide for you when you will see your child, but your child can know when you will be available just for her. This will lay the foundation for consistency and allow your child to have some security in troubled times.</p><p>I would highly recommend you sit down with your ex and discuss how you can both be a positive source in your child's life. How you can both be there to help raise her. If this is not a conversation that you can have on your own you might seek out help from the court. There are parenting experts and mediators who might be able to assist you.</p><p>Remember, in any discussion keep the focus on what is best for your child and you will be moving in the right direction.</p><p>Best of luck to you!</p>"

1302,Is it possible for a person to stop feeling emotions?,Trauma,"<p>First and foremost, be gentle and patient with yourself. It is normal to feel a range of emotions after a severe trauma including no emotions at all. Try not to push yourself to feel, just notice the lack of emotion you are experiencing right now. Maybe write about your emotions and the lack of them or talk about it with a safe person. Unfortunately recovering from trauma can take time and it's best done at your own pace. If you aren't feeling there may be a reason you aren't feeling. For severe trauma I always recommend working with a trained trauma professional who has the training to guide you on your path to healing fully.</p>"
1303,How do I get my husband to listen to me?,"Relationships,Marriage","<p>Thanks for reaching out. This is a great question. Communication is definitely a 2-way street. One person cannot participate in a discussion. It takes a talker and a listener. Furthermore, communication will breakdown if each party is only focusing on his or her agenda and is not open to what the other person is saying. &nbsp;since I can't ask you questions about what is going on, I am going to make a guess at one situation that comes up a lot when I work with couples. One person focuses more on solving the issue, than listening to their partner. &nbsp;This can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be ""heard.""</p><p>I understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. That can be really frustrating and difficult and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.</p><p>One of the best strategies to gettting heard, is actually to BE A GOOD LISTENER to someone else. I know you are probably already a good listener and for you to work on listening skills may seem counterintuitive, right? You want to get heard and now you are the one doing the listening. But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. In other words, you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:</p><ul><li>Pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. No texting or distractions. Lean in. Focus.</li><li>Listen for content and for emotion. Clarify what you don't understand. Try to understand the person's underlying emotions.&nbsp;</li><li>Don't rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on.&nbsp;</li><li>Encourage the other person to continue speaking, Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.</li><li>Ask questions to get to understand the other person's point of view.<br></li></ul><div>I believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills, and the other person feels heard, they will be more likely to listen to us. If you don't find that this doesn't spill over in that way, then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. If there is push back from him, set up a trial period to just try the skill, perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. If communication is really breaking down, then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Best of luck to you!</div>"

1308,How do I deal with parental figures who have hurt me?,"Depression,Family Conflict","<p>Hello. Adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. We carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. This is often easier said than done, but it is possible. From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. They themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. How are they behaving toward you now? Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. By forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. Talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.<br></p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1309,I’m afraid that I’m gay.,LGBTQ,"<p>Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be, can be emotionally disturbing, and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety, maybe even panic, and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys, or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you, because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to, say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual, and don't have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area, to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea, and others in a support group for sexuality issues, might be able to relate to you and what you're going through right now. This will offer you perspective, as you think on how this plays out in your life.</p><p>Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor, nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay, then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally, we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings, and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what, do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone, I promise.</p><p><br></p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMHC</p>"

1311,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","Therapy can feel very weird to begin with - think about it, how often do we go and tell a relative stranger our deepest, darkest thoughts in the rest of our life? So I think its reasonable to expect a certain level of nerves as you get used to your therapist and to the whole process of talking about yourself and vulnerable topics. That said, its definitely worth bringing to the attention of your therapist (if you haven't already) to see if there is anything that they can do, or that the two of you can explore together, that might make the process feel less intimidating to you."

1316,How can I be less stressed?,Stress,"Our body reacts to stress typically by breathing more shallowly, increasing our heart rate and tensing our muscles - so one thing that I find really effective is to try to do the opposite of that, which sends the signal to our mind that we are relaxed. So that means, taking slower, fuller breaths and trying to relax any areas where we might be gripping our muscles. Check out meditation apps such as 'Breathe', which can talk you through a relaxing breath exercise. I recommend using the app daily, whether you feel stressed or not, and then also using it when you re feeling particular moments of stress - that way you are practicing the skill when you feel calm(wish) and it'll be ready and able to help you when stress hits hard."

1330,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hello. Yes, counseling can be beneficial to many people. One of the effective components to effective therapy, is when the client becomes willing to participate in the counseling. I don't mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 45-50 minutes, but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place. This requires you to be vulnerable, capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself, and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable. Therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly, honestly, and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals - your improvement of self. It does take time, and there are no quick fixes (usually), so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places. You'll thank yourself later, knowing that you are more connected to yourself and might even feel more whole after the process. Be well.</p>"
1331,How does counseling help people?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"I love this question! Some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldn't need a counselor. However, if you are having a difficult time, counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know. For one, your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do. In that way, counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation. This gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings. A counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Over time, as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights. The work you do is based on you and where you are at. Oftentimes, when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation, and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you. A counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your plan.</div><div><br></div><div>Best of luck to you!</div>"

At least as a check in.</p>"
1337,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision. Here are a few examples.&nbsp;</p><p>The counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with. A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue. If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer. Beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues. This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit. No counselor is the right person to work with everyone. If the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work. A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session.&nbsp;</p><p>The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on. While this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end. However, counselors know that this is part of the process. They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end. This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these (and other) situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending, to monitoring how things are going, then engaging in self reflection, possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor &nbsp;follows through.&nbsp;</p>"
1338,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>This is a question that is very specific to each person. There are definitely some variables, but I can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:</p><ul><li>When a client has met all of their goals, at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselor</li><li>Sometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain time</li><li>Sometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. This depends on agency policy, but sometimes it is a requirement. If the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician, frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatly</li></ul><p>I'm not sure why you are asking this question, but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. Oftentimes ""discharge goals"" change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients, their goals, changes in their goals, and many other things. Changes are normal, but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind, at least generally, from the beginning. I strongly encourage you to ask about it!</p>"

1340,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including, but not limited to the client reaching their goals, the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. &nbsp;The last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. &nbsp;All of these things could happen, and usually happen organically (again, except for the last example).&nbsp;</p><p>Your question, however, was about the counselor ending treatment. This is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. &nbsp;It may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. &nbsp;It's important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?</p><p>In regular, open-ended sessions, I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. In these check-ins, I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. &nbsp;I also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. &nbsp;In goal-oriented sessions, I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. &nbsp;This is actually a great place to go with them; why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? Often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. That said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. It's a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that this brief response can assist you going forward!</p>"
1341,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p>There are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process, however they all start with picking up the phone. &nbsp;It's most definitely an uncomfortable feeling, but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief.&nbsp;</p><p>My recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment. Listening to how they converse, use their tone and inflection, may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away.

There are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy - take the time to pick one that suits you.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"
1342,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated:</p><p>1) Client has met therapy goals</p><p>2) Client is not progressing&nbsp;</p><p>3) Therapist is not a good fit for client</p><p>In order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made, the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessions-by-session to determine what is helping, what isn't, and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals. When a client has met their goals, that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to check-in periodically to make sure that they are still on track (sometimes referred to as relapse prevention).&nbsp;</p><p>When a client is not progressing, and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail, than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client. In these circumstances, referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea.</p>"

Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine, losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way, but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time, as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need.&nbsp;<br></p>"
1344,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Hello. The end of the counselor/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. Counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. Among them are the client's inability to make forward progress in therapy; the clinician's inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons); a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided; or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. In this last case, a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client's inability to pay. That is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. Other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client, which in itself should be paramount.</p><p>When the client and therapist decide that services are done, it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur, and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well, those this is perhaps not as important). This transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (An abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). Sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed, in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. In this case, the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy, to a place of healing, growth and situational resolution.</p><p>I have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will), that I learned years ago during graduate school: ""Not every therapist is good for every client, and not every client is good for every therapist."" It is perhaps one of the most important guiding views I hold in working with clients. The therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life, and the therapist's desire to truly see the client heal and grow. When there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring, the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. Or, if already formed, may at some point be unable to move forward. In these instances, referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. Usually, this can be seen pretty quickly by either party, though sometimes it is not always clear.</p><p>Ultimately, the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor, or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. If both are observant in this process, they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. Eventually, therapy will end, but hopefully based on the client's successful journey to the place where they wanted to go, and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter.</p>"
1345,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hello. Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way. Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.</p><p>Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet. That first session is often very low key. There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details. All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.</p><p>In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous. Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor. It's true. We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. What makes it even more challenging, is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we're standing on a three legged stool). This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. Counselors and clients are both human, and we both make mistakes. Coming from that place of understanding, might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors, is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. We honestly do not, plain and simple. Counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life's road than you); they hold completion of various forms of training; and have advanced education. Yet we are in the end, imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. Very often, we can find ourselves reflected in our clients' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. So as you begin to seek out a therapist, try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength, and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy.</p>"
1346,"I'm in a relationship, and I think I like my ex-boyfriend. Who do I choose?",Relationships,"<p>Hello. The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being ""dumped"" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can ""dump"" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.</p><p>You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?</p><p>Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.</p>"
1347,How can I cope with work related stress better?,"Stress,Workplace Relationships","<p>Hello. Workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive. The interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag, and sorting that out can be difficult. Also, if you are feeling under appreciated and not well paid, this can add bitterness to your lot of emotions. A few questions can be kept in mind as you work through your situation. Do you have the option of talking to your employer about your experiences and feelings with regard to your current work? Do you have local resources that you can use to find different jobs in your field? Do you have connections with employment counselors or agencies that can support you with strategies in dealing with workplace stress? These questions might cause others to bubble up, and could begin a new journey into a new field.</p><p>While still at your job, what can you do to take care of yourself? Are you taking breaks? Do you eat lunch at the office, or do you go somewhere away from the office to eat? What do you do when you have a few moments to breathe? Understanding that you can indeed find even the smallest strategies useful for self-care, can help bolster your energy and give you some support as you move through the day. Seeking the support of family and friends can be helpful as well. Knowing your personal limits and when to pull back and take a break will give you a chance to recharge your mental and physical energy, thus helping you face the demands of your job.&nbsp;</p>"
1348,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hi! Great question! My suggestion would be to google therapists in your area. &nbsp;One great website is called Psychology Today, which is a National site. &nbsp;You can search for therapists in your zip code and search more specifically for the issue you are seeking support about. &nbsp;It's a great way to find out if they therapist has a speciality, accepts insurance and whether they offer a free phone consultation. I would then make a list of the ones that may be a good fit and then give them a call! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Hope this helps. Remember you get to ask anything you need to, to determine if someone is a good fit. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to ask anything! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Best of luck!</p>"
1349,How do I tell a girl that I crossdress?,"Human Sexuality,LGBTQ,Intimacy","<p>Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.</p><p>As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.</p><p>I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.</p><p>I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.</p><p>Are you comfortable answering questions?</p><p>I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:</p><ul><li>What exactly is cross-dressing?</li><li>Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?</li><li>What does it mean to you?</li><li>Why is it important to you?</li><li>And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.</li></ul><p>There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.</p><p>I certainly hope that you find the right person for you.

1350,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions. It's really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling, so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions. Sometimes, however, a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselor's expertise. That's a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of &nbsp;how best to meet them, whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider.</p>"

1360,My family says I have depression.,Depression,"<p>Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live, and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution, or to have value and worth with the people around us, and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough, you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life, and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself; following current fashions; possessing the trendy things; and hanging out with the ""in crowd."" Here's a ""secret"" that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I've just described will really matter as they might seem to right now, in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers), I can assure you that being someone who is kind; compassionate; understanding of another person's suffering; and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world, will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.</p><p>When we are young, we judge everything based on what our peers have, what they say, the way they dress, who's popular, who's not popular, and for the most of it, all of that is external. So the question becomes, are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff), with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say, do you feel that if you had what your friends have, you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger, it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post, you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated, or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed, might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it, which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind, that as a teenager, your emotions are often being experienced very randomly, and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development, but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).</p><p>Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings, or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not, there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself, but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https://teenlineonline.org/). It helped me when I was in my teens, and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly, you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.</p><p>Don't be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don't always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress, fear, and uncertainty. But you are not alone, and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best, and bright future.&nbsp;</p>"

1372,How long do I wait on my ex-fiancé to choose me over his ex-girlfriend?,"Family Conflict,Relationships,Relationship Dissolution ","<p>Hello. It seems you are in a set of circumstances that are highly uncomfortable for you. Do you feel those circumstances are healthy? Do you find pleasure being in such a place of uncertainty? Why do you continue to be in this situation? Without meaning to appear that I might be lacking in compassion, you do have the option to leave the connection completely if the harm it is doing is more that the pleasure it brings you. Is there a benefit to being in this relationship? Do you consider this situation to be for your highest good? Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth, only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation, and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read, this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want, nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.</p><p>Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop, and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice, but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self, for the most clear answer. Chances are, you already know the answer, you just need to embrace it. Getting in touch with a counselor in your area can also help ferret out some of the deeper issues that you might not have felt comfortable expressing here.</p>"

It is actually difficult to comprehend the concept that we don't always have control of what happens in life. &nbsp;In addition, when you mentioned feeling like a sociopath, it sounded like you feel like your reaction is wrong. &nbsp;The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k., you aren't doing anything wrong, and nothing is wrong with you. &nbsp;</p><p>The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings, and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness. &nbsp;</p><p>Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help. &nbsp;If doesn't sound like you need to do anything to change yourself, but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience. &nbsp;</p><p>I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38); font-family: Overlock; font-size: 20px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; background-color: rgb(229, 239, 241);""><br></span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

1375,I'm addicted to smoking. How can I stop?,"Substance Abuse,Addiction","<p>Quitting smoking can be difficult. It's also true that there is part that is sometimes a physical need and a part that is often connected to emotions in some way. From the way that you wrote this, it sounds like you may have been able to stop smoking physically, but still have cravings.</p><p>One thing you can do is talk with your primary care physician or OB/GYN about whether there is anything that you can take to help with the cravings. Sometimes that can very helpful.</p><p>As far as the more emotional or mental piece, these things come to mind:</p><ul><li>Sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. There are sometimes toys, like those available at Office Playground, that may help to keep you physically occupied.</li><li>There can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette, you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. The list is endless, but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well, completing a puzzle, learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting, perhaps).</li><li>Another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes, perhaps irritability. Depending on what it is that you may be feeling, &nbsp;learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.</li><li>This can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change. I would recommend that if things do not become easier for you, consider talking with a therapist.

Chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been
difficult. Saying goodbye to a therapist can be different. It can be an

If you work with a therapist who is skilled, then saying goodbye can be just as

as “termination.” I know, “termination” doesn’t have a great ring to it!
However, it is what it is. It is an ending of the relationship as it existed.
It is reality cold and stark. Of course, when I talk to clients I don’t use the
word “termination,” I usually say “our goodbye.” &nbsp;Under what circumstances does therapy usually
end? Therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance, is not
receiving any benefit from therapy, or might be harmed by continuing to work
with a particular therapist.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">In the best case scenario
the decision to move on from therapy and “say our goodbyes” happens when both
the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move
up!&nbsp; Ending the therapeutic relationship
should actually be worked on from the very first session. What I mean by that
is, there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an
ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the
skills to continue working on themselves independently. So the first session I
have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and
we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what
they hope to achieve. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Now sometimes there are

is dealing with is out of the therapist's scope of practice, the therapist may
end the relationship and refer the client to someone else. This is in the
client’s best interest. Another reason a therapist might end the relationship
is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being
objective and helpful.&nbsp; A therapist who
is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple
that considering divorce. A good therapist may see that their judgement may be
clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else. This is good practice
and helps the client.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">If a client is actively
suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the
relationship and refer out for a higher level of care. The client may need to
be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program.
Therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after
the intensive program is completed.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>

closure. For some clients, it may be the one time in their lives when they get
a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of
control on creating that ending.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Good luck to you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>"

1387,What happens in a counseling session?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>After meeting a client, many Counselors will ask you lots of questions in order to complete a thorough assessment of what you came to counseling for. This assessment is required by most insurances and allows the Counselor to give a diagnosis, which is also required by most insurances in order for them to pay the Counselor. If you are paying out of pocket, this diagnosis is not really required for payment, but many Counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us. The better we understand what it is that bothers you, what you would like to get out of the counseling, and all the various things that tend to affect people such as family upbringing and medical issues, the easier it is for us to help you reach those goals. How the counseling actually plays out from there depends a lot on the theory that the Counselor uses to direct their approach to counseling, and that information is too much for this little post.</p>"
1388,Is it normal to cry during therapy?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ",<p>Many people cry during their therapy sessions. Actually most people cry in their therapist's office. I tell my clients that it's safe to cry in my office and crying isn't a sign of weakness. It's a normal human response to pain. People actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying. Crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many people.<br></p>
1389,How does counseling end?,"Professional Ethics,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>In general, I usually let the client decide when this should occur, sometimes with some clients it will be a joint agreement, but even in that case it should weigh mostly on what the client feels.

1392,How can I help myself and change my behavior?,"Behavioral Change,Anxiety","<p>Hello. I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you. In other words, does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it. Yes, this could well be an expression of anxiety, or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee-jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific (or perhaps even non-specific) circumstances. Do you think it is a self-soothing behavior? Do you feel good after you have done it? The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage, so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor, to rule out any injury. If none exists, this obviously doesn't excuse the behavior, it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.</p><p>When we do any behavior of any kind, it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem, or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue, when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there, but now they are intoxicated. No closer to solving the issue. When we deal with things like anxiety or depression, we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms, but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm, but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.</p><p>Sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self-harm, wouldn't you agree? So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings, as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.</p><p>Reach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you.</p>"
1393,How can I best fight the winter blues?,Depression,"<p>One theory is that instead of ""fighting"" your feelings, accept your sad feelings and work with them. &nbsp; Feeling sad may open many doors to reflect and make peace with the source of your sadness.</p><p>Also, I believe fighting against the natural cycle of rest and hibernation may not even be possible to succeed. &nbsp; Winter for most creatures is a time of withdrawal and slowdown. &nbsp;Our bodies and moods are part of nature as well. &nbsp;Fighting what is part of nature seems like a tiring fight which the person will lose.</p><p>Last point, there are the winter holidays to break up the dark and cold of winter. &nbsp; Maybe you can invent some of your own winter celebrations so you'll have a few gatherings to look forward to hosting.</p>"

1396,Is this depression?,Depression,"<p>It sounds like you are trying to find a label to help you to understand why you are feeling the way you are feeling. &nbsp;Sometimes there are no labels for how we feel. &nbsp;Sometimes there is no name for the emotions that we are experiencing. Regardless, you do not have to continue to feel this way, no matter what you call it. &nbsp;If you are seeking to experience an internal calmness such as your external calmness, you may want to try some mindfulness practices or meditation. &nbsp;However, being able to get at the root cause of what you are feeling may be what you need to help you release this feeling for the long term. &nbsp;I recommend seeking support for this to allow this internal screaming to get some air and begin to breathe.&nbsp;</p>"
1397,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,<p>The first thing to do is to reflect on what you want to seek counseling. Search online and then set up a phone consultation. A person can find out a lot about a counselor and the services that they offer over the phone. After a consultation then set up an intake questions. The overall goal is to make sure that you are comfortable with the counselor and the services they can offer.</p>
1398,Why can't I stop these thoughts?,Diagnosis,"<p>First off, there is nothing wrong with you. &nbsp;In fact, having random thoughts we feel we cannot control is actually quite common and normal. &nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes our thoughts think they are protecting us (if we think we aren't worth anything, it won't hurt when we get rejected) but they are actually doing quite the opposite. &nbsp;They are keeping us ""stuck"" and creating a self-prophization. &nbsp;(If I think I am not worth anything, I don't have to try, and I will keep proving to myself that I am not worth anything). &nbsp;</p><p>There are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative self-talk. &nbsp;There are actually many self-help workbooks that can help with this as well. &nbsp;</p><p>A technique I like to use is meditation or mindfulness. &nbsp;This can teach us to accept our thoughts (not fight them) and then learn to let them go. &nbsp;Release the power they have on us. &nbsp;If we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them, this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in. &nbsp;</p><p>Mantras can help with this as well (I AM worth a lot, I AM important, I have value). &nbsp;Saying these to yourself everyday over and over (even if at first you don't believe) can retrain our brains to believe it (and allow us to believe it). &nbsp;I have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so I am forced to look at these throughout the day.</p><p>Please remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns. &nbsp;It took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal. &nbsp;So allow the process to happen slowly and allow yourself to accept you as the amazing and brave person you are. &nbsp;</p>"
1399,I over endulge when I drink alcohol and feel extremely guilty about it the next day.,"Substance Abuse,Social Relationships",<p>Speaking with a licensed therapist will help you figure out if indeed you have a problem or not. &nbsp;I would say the first question you should ask yourself is why you are drinking? The second would be why you feel the need to drink in excess? It may be due to a life event or the crowd you are running with. &nbsp;Either way a therapist will be able to help you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
1400,How do I fix my relationship?,"Relationships,Addiction","<p>I would first suggest you sitting down with him and voicing your concerns about how distant he has been, or more importantly you have felt that he is. &nbsp;This will give clarification to the situation as we need to remember that everyone's perception can be different. Remember that relationships take work and take communication.</p>"
1401,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,<p>I think it is important that you are able to convey what you are looking for in a therapist even if that changes over time. &nbsp;You need to look at it like you are interviewing the counselor and that they will be able to provide you with the therapy you need. &nbsp;To many times we do not know and it ends up not being a good fit and then people are left with a bad experience and do not want to re-engage. &nbsp;Remembering you are basically hiring someone to help you so I would treat it as such. Do some research and be clear as to why you are coming to therapy and ask questions as how they will be able to help you.&nbsp;</p>
1402,My brother is an addict. He has does nothing but ruin my family. I don't know how to cope with it anymore.,"Family Conflict,Addiction,Substance Abuse",<p>I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation. &nbsp;It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted. &nbsp;It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself. &nbsp;Other individuals need to take the same accountability. &nbsp;Enabling often happens in households with addiction. It can be a challenging environment to live in. &nbsp;</p>
1403,My mother is trying to control my life and I don't know what to do.,"Family Conflict,Parenting","<p>Unfortunately I think most of us have heard this, so you are not alone. &nbsp;If you are still under her roof she has leverage as to what her expectations are while you are living there. &nbsp;I would consider therapy for the both of you to see if there could be a middle ground that could be agreed upon. &nbsp;Often times a 3rd party can help with conflict. &nbsp;If there is no resolution then I would look to get creative in finding a place of your own.&nbsp;</p>"
1404,What can I do about my children blaming me for their addictions?,"Parenting,Addiction","<p>Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms. &nbsp;It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us. &nbsp;You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden. &nbsp;We are all in charge of the choices we make. &nbsp;No one makes us do something other than our self. &nbsp;We choose how we internalize and react to situations. &nbsp;I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward. &nbsp;</p>"
1405,How do I help my husband get over his drinking addiction?,Addiction,"<p>Acknowledgment from your husband and wiling to make changes is essential first. &nbsp;We often try to force people to make changes hoping that they will see that we are right, even when they may not be ready. &nbsp;Having a willingness to work together and be supportive is fundamental in recovery. &nbsp;If he is not quite there yet I would snuggest individual therapy for yourself where you have an outlet and can also gain suggestions on what the next steps might be. If he is ready I would suggest you engage in therapy together and be ready to listen to him and what his needs might be.&nbsp;</p>"
1406,I found drugs in my moms drawer—what should I do?,Substance Abuse,<p>I would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom. &nbsp;Usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed. &nbsp;Be aware of behavior changes and mood swings. &nbsp;Be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help.&nbsp;</p>
1407,What is the best way to cope with the loss of someone to suicide?,"Grief and Loss,Substance Abuse,Trauma",<p>First I am so sorry for your loss. &nbsp;Most people go through the grieving process. &nbsp;I would get a better understanding of what that process is. &nbsp;Everyone has their own way of handling loss. &nbsp;You are taking the first step in realizing that you are having a difficult time coping with it. &nbsp;I would reach out to a therapist that has experience treatment patients with loss. I would also recognize that drinking and smoking are both substances that will not make depression or depressive thoughts any better. &nbsp;</p>
1408,Is it okay if I take my friend's pills away?,"Social Relationships,Substance Abuse",<p>Your friend needs to admit they have a problem. &nbsp;If not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more. &nbsp;It is also a federal offense to take someone else's medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested. &nbsp;In other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them. &nbsp;Like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways. &nbsp;I would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation. &nbsp;Encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her.&nbsp;</p>
1409,I don't know if my ex-boyfriend is using opiates again.,"Relationships,Addiction,Substance Abuse","<p>Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain, there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well. &nbsp;I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns. &nbsp;Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals. &nbsp;Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when re-engaging in personal relationships.&nbsp;</p>"
1410,My boyfriend is upset about my friendship with another guy,"Relationships,Social Relationships","<p>The most important thing to ask yourself here is, ""how did this action affect my relationship, and is it worth the consequences?"" Regardless of your intentions in this action, your boyfriend is uncomfortable with this type of behavior. From here, we can objectively decide if spending time with your previous partner (because that is likely what your boyfriend sees them as) is worth harming the relationship you currently have. It is very rare that a person would be comfortable with their partner spending more than a very little amount of time with their exes. Many times, it just gives the wrong impressions. It is very possible that your partner may believe that since you spend so much time with them, that they are still a contender for the most intimate relationship you have to offer, and truth be told, they kind of are. The best intimate relationships, are friendships first and foremost.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is also a good thing to consider what you are getting out of the relationship with your ex that you are not getting out of the relationship with your current boyfriend. If you go to this person for emotional support before your boyfriend, then it is very likely you're involved in some ""emotional infidelity"". When we turn to others instead of our partner, it is as if we ""ran into another person's arms"" instead of theirs. No matter who you are, that hurts.&nbsp;</p>"
1411,My family says I have depression.,Depression,"<p>Although some people managing depression feel sad or ""down"", &nbsp;it&nbsp;is a possible to have depression without an obvious sad mood. &nbsp;Many people indicate that they feel numb or flat. &nbsp;People managing depression often have low motivation.&nbsp;They may stay in bed for long periods of time and only get up for absolutely necessary activities. &nbsp;People with depression may also feel inappropriate guilt or shame. &nbsp; If you have been experiencing the symptoms you described for more than two weeks, I recommend that you see a counselor to get a more in-depth&nbsp;evaluation. &nbsp; The symptoms you are experiencing are typical of depression, and with a bit of support, you could regain energy and improved self-esteem. &nbsp;The stigma surrounding mental health can make a diagnosis or a label&nbsp;of depression seem scary. &nbsp;The important thing to remember is that mental health disorders are as important as and as treatable physical health disorders. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hang in there. &nbsp;Healing is possible!&nbsp;</p>"
1412,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Approaching a counselor can seem intimidating at first, but most mental health professionals want to help you feel safe and heard. &nbsp;You can often find counselors using search engines like CounselChat or Psychology Today. &nbsp;These websites allow you to get to know therapists before you take the next step. &nbsp;These days, counselors have websites where you can learn even more. &nbsp;These websites usually have clear instructions for contact. &nbsp;Typically, you can reach out via phone or email to request a consultation. &nbsp;During a consultation call, you can ask the therapist questions about their credentials and areas of expertise. &nbsp;If you feel like you connect, you can schedule a first session where you will tell them more about yourself and why you are seeking therapy. &nbsp;The thing to remember is that therapists want you to reach out to them, and they are happy to be approached for support. &nbsp;Good luck! &nbsp;</p>"
1413,I'm worried about my new job.,"Anxiety,Career Counseling","<p>First of all, congratulations on your new role! Transitions can be challenging, and it sounds like you are experiencing a lot of change. &nbsp;This would be difficult for many people, and it seems that you have an added layer of challenge. &nbsp;I recommend&nbsp;visiting a therapist to determine the root cause of your anxiety and working to unravel those causes piece by piece. I know seeing a therapist can be challenging when traveling, and online counseling could be a good solution. In the meantime, here are a few of my favorite anxiety stopping strategies. &nbsp;1. Grounding Exercises: When you feel your anxiety increasing, take a deep breath and begin things in your room (or where ever you are) that have things in common. For example, name all of the blue things that you can see. &nbsp;You can also do non-visual grounding&nbsp;exercises like&nbsp;naming all of the hte&nbsp;sports teams you can think of or all of the state capitals. &nbsp;This will get your mind off of your anxiety and connect you to space. &nbsp;2. The pretzel: This is a seated pose that will stop any anxiety attack in its tracks. &nbsp;Start in a seated position and cross your dominate leg over your nondominant leg. Then, stretch your arms out in front of you with the back of your hands facing one another. &nbsp;Cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching. &nbsp;Flip your arms into your body. &nbsp;You will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin. &nbsp;Close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. &nbsp;This calming pose will help you get through even the toughest of panic episodes. 3. Bilateral stimulation and visualization: Start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. Tap each knee in an alternating pattern. Close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. The combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind. &nbsp;I could go on and on, but these techniques should get you started. &nbsp;These techniques should help you manage anxiety in a pinch. &nbsp;Best of luck!&nbsp;</p>"
1414,"I'm in high school, and I want to be a psychologist.","Career Counseling,Professional Ethics","<p>Mental Health is an exciting and rewarding field. &nbsp;I hear you saying that you want to be a psychologist, and that is one path to working in mental health. &nbsp;You could study psychology,&nbsp;social work or counseling to become a practicing therapist. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate and a Licensed Clinical&nbsp;Addiction Specialist. &nbsp;I currently provide assessments and supervise several counselors in a large clinic in Asheville. &nbsp;I also have a private practice online. I studied Sociology and Interpersonal Communication as an undergraduate, and then I received a counseling masters degree. &nbsp; My master's degree was comprised of several supervised practice courses and theory courses. &nbsp; &nbsp;I really enjoyed my education, and I find my career equally rewarding and enjoyable. If you are considering working in the field, I recommend emailing several counselors, social workers, and psychologists in your area and setting up an informational interview. &nbsp;Not everyone you contact will be willing to give you their time, but many may. &nbsp; This will help you determine which path to therapy may be right for you. &nbsp;Licensing restrictions and abilities&nbsp;vary state to state and a local practitioner may be able to provide you with a specific list of challenges/triumphs about their particular license and education. &nbsp; &nbsp;Psychologists are usually PhD level practitioners and require more education to begin. &nbsp;LCSWs , LPCs and LMFTS can practice with a master's degree. &nbsp;Best of luck! This is an exciting time. &nbsp;</p>"
1415,How do I make myself happy without someone who made me happy?,"Depression,Relationships","<p>Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.</p><p>What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.</p><p>I wish you happiness for every day of your life.</p><p>Best wishes.</p>"
1416,How do I save my marriage?,"Domestic Violence,Anger Management,Self-esteem,Marriage,Family Conflict","<p>Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight, and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work, and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good, bad, or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions, and I won't presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost, cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed, but in the end we learn, and that learning helps us grow. Yes, you're right, the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good, and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard, and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself, and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve, that, while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life, they are separate from your marriage in many respects.</p><p>Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community, then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed, so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.</p><p>Lastly, parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that, we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future, no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid, and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves, and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. &nbsp;I am sure that remains to be seen, but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares, then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That's not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants, and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said, seek out supportive friends, and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other, you will benefit from it.</p><p>Be well.</p>"
1417,How can I cope with work related stress better?,"Stress,Workplace Relationships","It sounds like you are experiencing burnout and have very little, if no job satisfaction. &nbsp;There are some aspects of this that are in your control and others that are not. &nbsp;What type of work do you typically enjoy? &nbsp;Do you enjoy high stress work? What keeps you in this job? Is there a reason you have stayed? &nbsp;Is your boss reasonable to have a conversation with? &nbsp;<div>I recommend a few things. &nbsp;For one, you may want to have a discussion with your boss about your job duties and see if there is a way to either eliminate some responsibilities or get higher pay. &nbsp;</div><div>Another option, if you are unable to have an open conversation, you can start to look at an ideal work situation, what would you like/ be OK with/ absolutely hate about a job.

1418,How does someone approach a counselor?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>The easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online. A quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful. There are lots of Counselors out there to choose from, so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that. Check out their website, social media, and any reviews (but remember, people are not always very nice). If you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services, look for one that is in your network. You can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurance's website. If your coverage isn't that great and you know you're going to be paying for it all anyway (because you're an all-star and verified your coverage already with the insurance company), then you can really pick any Counselor you want, but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible. If you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once you've started counseling, <a href=""https://getbetter.co/"" target=""_blank"">Better</a> is a good option. Once you've found a Counselor you think is a good fit for you, normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment. With many Counselors you can now send an email, but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic. Once you're all scheduled, they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in, or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there. From there, all you have to do is show up!</p>"
1419,Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>It can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial. Since you're already going to counseling, congratulations on taking that big, first, stress-inducing step. Hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist. It can be helpful to address this big ""elephant in the room"" and talk to your therapist about this. I do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling, but regardless of how hard we try, sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to. The good news is, the more you keep at it, the more ""normal"" it will become.&nbsp;</p>"

1422,How can I make the voices stop?,Anxiety,"<p>You are right. It is not normal to hear voices that aren't your own but the fact is some people do. In my experience, medication seem to help. It is also important to understand when you hear voices the most - meaning it is important to understand what the triggers are. It is also important to understand when the voices are the least - meaning what helps you deal with the voices better. My clients have reported that their triggers are being in social gathering or around strangers or for some even the TV. Trying to identify your triggers is helpful for some people. Clients have also reported that listening to music, watching TV, being with friend or family helps them deal with their voices. Every individual is different and you need to figure out what works for you and what triggers your voices. My suggestion is to see a therapist / health care provider and then go from there.</p><p>I hope this helps. &nbsp;</p>"

1429,My boyfriend is upset about my friendship with another guy,"Relationships,Social Relationships","<p>Hello. There are a number of factors playing into this situation. A former romantic partner coming back onto the scene during a current relationship; you spending alone time (and spending the night) with that former partner; and the uneasy feelings experienced by your current partner (boyfriend). Now those are the ones you have openly expressed. There are very likely other issues that prompted this behavior on your part. You ask if you were wrong. It is not a question I will be able to answer, because it is not one I am meant to answer. It is up to you to find that truth. Now, if you are feeling guilty, was it because of some sexual engagement occurred when you spent the night? If so, you might want to look at why that happened. Do you feel secure in your current relationship? Is this the relationship you want, or do you want to be with the former boyfriend?</p><p>Important questions, but ones you need to ask and answer.

Our thoughts are processed through schemes, these are mental images or templates by which we make meaning of the world around us. &nbsp;While our upbringing has a great influence on the way we see and interact with the world around us as adults, However, we are not condemned to abide by them for life, in psychotherapy, you learn to change negative&nbsp;schemas with positive ones. Yeah, if you had less than optimal childhood you would have some sort of negative schemas that unconsciously lead to self-sabotage your efforts for success and happiness. The research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology suggests that without conscious awareness and reflective practices we tend to interact with the world by repeating old habits of mind. On the other hand, in psychotherapy you can learn helpful&nbsp;strategies to increase your conscious abilities to stay in control of your mind in the present moment and reduce intrusions of negative mind habits.&nbsp;</div><div>Yoga, meditation, and tai&nbsp;chi are also found to increase self-awareness and lessen the intrusions of negative self-judgment on one's&nbsp;psyche.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div></div>"

Even though legally you are an adult, it is a matter of courtesy to respect the homes of your parents. As long as you live there, you should be considerate of their needs.

Your mother knows you are an adult, but has not had as many years of treating you like one. So mentally and emotionally this will take some time for her to adapt. Share your concerns with her, and see if you can come up with a set of rules that you both can honor. It will be a great stepping stone for both of you as you move into this new chapter together as you begin relating a little differently.<div><br></div><div>Reach out for help to a counselor if needed. You don't have to sort this out on your own. And lastly, take good care of yourself in the process. You are moving through some exciting times in your life. The more you can have support as you explore new events, the better you might feel less stressed.</div><div><br></div><div>Warm regards.</div>"
1454,How to get over somebody?,Relationship Dissolution ,"<p>What you're most likely trying to get over is to be attracted to the qualities which you felt attracted to in the person.</p><p>The problem isn't releasing yourself from the person, per se. &nbsp; Letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you value.</p><p>Two possibilities exist.</p><p>Either you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and you'd like to base your next relationship on these qualities.</p><p>Or, the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship ended.</p><p>It is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationship.</p><p>See if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a couple.</p><p>If you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life, you'll attract a partner who has similar qualities.</p><p>Basically people attract what they need.</p><p>The more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner, the more likely your next partner will have these qualities.</p><p>In this way, you'll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationship.&nbsp;<br></p>"

Studies show that the most important element in effective therapy is that you feel a connection with your counselor. &nbsp;Trust your instincts and if you don't feel comfortable, let him or her know that you don't think it's a good fit. &nbsp;Many counselors list on websites like Psychology Today and Good Therapy. &nbsp;Visit these websites to learn more about therapists in your area.</p>"
1465,Why can't I stop these thoughts?,Diagnosis,"<p>Many people have thoughts like those you describe, and often it feels like someone else is saying it because they are things that may have been said to you when you were very young. &nbsp;When young children hear negative things about themselves they tend to internalize these negative ideas and to form negative core beliefs. &nbsp;The good news is we can learn to stop these thoughts and to replace them with healthier thoughts. &nbsp;The first step is to catch yourself when you are thinking these thoughts, and to stay ""stop!""; then replace it with another thought. &nbsp;So for instance, maybe you fail a test or get rejected by a romantic interest. &nbsp;You catch yourself saying ""you aren't worth anything"". Stop this thought, and replace it with ""You didn't do as well on that test as you would have liked. &nbsp;Let's figure out how you can do better next time."" &nbsp;Or ""she may not want to go out with you, but someone else will"". So the idea is to develop a voice of a ""friend"", who can tell you the kind of things you would say to your own best friend. &nbsp;You might also pick up the book, Feeling Good, by David Burns. He gives many tips for how to change Negative Self Talk.</p>"
1466,I'm addicted to smoking. How can I stop?,"Substance Abuse,Addiction","<p>Breaking any habit is no easy feat. &nbsp; Cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging, and there aren't any one size fits all solutions. &nbsp;Fortunately, there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking. &nbsp;1. Many habits that we have are paired habits. If we do one thing, then we will do the other thing. &nbsp;Think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking. &nbsp;For instance, many people smoke while they drive. &nbsp;Consider planning another activity to do while driving. (It might not be driving for you, but you get the idea! :)). &nbsp;It might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work. &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;Create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break. &nbsp;This approach could be used in a variety of different ways. &nbsp;If you smoke first thing in the morning, consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home. &nbsp;Walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke. &nbsp; Leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes. &nbsp;With this strategy, you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them. &nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;Consider cutting back before cutting out. &nbsp;If you are smoking 10 cigarettes a day, try smoking 9. Then cut back to 8 and so on. &nbsp;Having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>4. &nbsp;You could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches. If you aren't already pregnant, this could be a great resource to help boost your success. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing. You may be losing cigarettes,&nbsp;but you are gaining money, health, taste buds, an increased sense of smell, lung capacity, a healthy baby etc. &nbsp;You could plan small rewards/ treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases. &nbsp;I recommend&nbsp;making these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck! Cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby. &nbsp;</p>"

If seeking another career opportunity isn't viable, there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;1. Have a ritual to begin the day: &nbsp;Consider setting a one sentence intention and plan tasks for the day</p><p>2. Take the breaks you are offered. I know it can be difficult to step away from your desk to eat lunch or take 10-minute&nbsp;breaks during the day, but prioritize this if you can. Sometimes 30 minutes of downtime and fresh air can help you feel better.&nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;Have a ritual to end the day: &nbsp;If you commute by car consider an end of the day playlist. &nbsp;Take a walk. Light a candle. &nbsp;Clear your desk and write tasks for the next day. Whatever it is, send a signal to your brain that it is time to end the day.</p><p>4. If you do work from home or are expected to be available&nbsp;after hours, set boundaries where you can. &nbsp;Set a timer for answering emails and stick to that. &nbsp;Have phone free meals. &nbsp; &nbsp;Try to engage in activities that are rejuvenating like spending time the friends and family. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Try to limit alcohol/ drugs. &nbsp;Move as much as you can. &nbsp;Get outside in natural sunlight. &nbsp;</p><p>These are just ideas/ suggestions. &nbsp;Even doing one of these things could be a step in the right direction. &nbsp;Best of luck!&nbsp;</p>"

1473,My daughter isn't acting her age.,"Parenting,Children & Adolescents","<p>Hello.</p><p>It sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior . &nbsp; It's really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on . &nbsp;You are clearly an observant and hands on &nbsp;mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a tough question to answer without more information . &nbsp;With that said , I have found that ""under stress people regress."" &nbsp;In other words , many people , children and adults alike , often regress and behave differently - as if they were younger than their actual age - when under stress . &nbsp; Therefore , my first question would be : has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress ? &nbsp;This could be anything from conflict at home , recent changes such as moving , divorce , a loss of some kind , switching schools , or losing a friend or friends . &nbsp; Additionally , sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers , they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence . &nbsp; &nbsp;I would suggest that you think about what stressors / changes may have occurred recently. &nbsp;You may also want to check in with her teacher (s) to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughter's behavior at school .</p><p>I also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her. &nbsp;Something as simple as "" I have noticed that you aren't spending time with the friends you used to hang out with ; it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately . &nbsp;Am I right about that ? "" and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as : ""did something happen with your friends that &nbsp;is making you not want to be with them?"" ""Has something been bothering you lately ? Are you feeling upset or worried ? ""&nbsp;</p><p>If she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say "" I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried , I tend to act a little differently - sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends , or I get cranky and feel less like myself . &nbsp;I wonder if something like that is happening with you ?""&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and / or her teachers , perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might &nbsp;help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times , or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively . The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter , including any changes or new stressors , &nbsp;any possible patterns to this behavior , if school has become more difficult socially and or academically , the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Good luck! &nbsp; I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children's behavior. &nbsp;I do, though, think that you will feel more assured about this &nbsp;if you can get to the bottom of what's going on . &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1474,What happens in a counseling session?,Counseling Fundamentals ,"<p>Hi. &nbsp;This is an excellent question ! &nbsp; I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist . &nbsp;In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person'a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress . &nbsp;I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track. &nbsp;We would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns . &nbsp;Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful . &nbsp; I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this. &nbsp;I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won't try just to avoid ""hurting my feelings"" or ""offending me."" &nbsp;I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful &nbsp;strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don't like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan . &nbsp;We the &nbsp; work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along. &nbsp; If things aren't improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new !&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this is helpful for you !&nbsp;</p>"
1475,Is it normal to cry during therapy?,"Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals ","<p>Hi there ! &nbsp;As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another. &nbsp;Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe , &nbsp;you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. &nbsp;I have seen &nbsp;people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard. &nbsp; I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry &nbsp;and there is nothing to be embarrassed about. &nbsp; Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down. &nbsp; Crying is &nbsp;often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .</p><p>So , to summarize , don't worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable &nbsp;at first , but I promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy. &nbsp; And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won't judge you !</p><p>Good luck !!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"
1476,How should I handle the child I had with my ex-wife?,"Parenting,Relationship Dissolution ","<p>The thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. Children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. Because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks it's their fault.&nbsp;</p><p>As hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. This makes the belief even more strong for them. They start to think, ""why does dad keep leaving? What am I doing to keep making him go away?""</p><p>I believe a child needs both parents in their life. Whether she used you for a child or not, that child still exists and never asked for this. They didn't ask to be born into drama and two parents that can't make things work.&nbsp;</p><p>You can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child. If you start over far away, this may mean less visits but you'll still be a part of their life. Just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it. Every child deserves that much.&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck to you! :-)</p>"
1477,Is it healthy to embarrass a child as punishment?,"Parenting,Family Conflict","<p>Absolutely not!&nbsp;</p><p>It is never in a child's best interest to use humiliation as punishment. This can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the child's social relationships. Kids have a hard enough time. To then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful, healthy adult. You do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake. Discipline shouldn't be seen as punishment. It should be seen as a way to teach a lesson. What lesson could this possibility be teaching him? Absolutely nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>She should be one of the people he can come to when he's hurting; not someone who causes him pain.</p>"
